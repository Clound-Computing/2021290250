Never did she imagine, though, that she would grow up to be a real-life, bona fide Disney Princess.\n\nThen, after earning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Kim in the Broadway musical \u201cMiss Saigon\u201d in 1991, Salonga landed the career break of a lifetime: to be the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in the 1992 hit Disney film \u201cAladdin.\u201d\n\nSix years later, she got a second chance to live her young girl\u2019s dream as she performed the vocals of Mulan in the 1998 Disney film of that name.\n\n\u201cI never thought when I was 5 and listening to \u2018Cinderella\u2019 stories that I\u2019d be a Disney princess. I think it\u2019s such a magical thing to happen in my life, and for it to happen twice is something I would never have thought could happen,\u201d said Salonga in a recent phone interview.\n\nSalonga\u2019s distinctive voice will return to Southern California for concerts tonight at the Valley Performing Arts Center in Northridge and Saturday at Segerstrom Center for the Arts. Backed by a four-piece band, Salonga will perform a selection of well-known songs, including her greatest hits from her various musicals and films.\n\n\u201cWe made sure to choose a fun program that the band is going to dig playing and I\u2019m going to love singing,\u201d said Salonga, \u201cand because we are having so much fun onstage, I hope that translates to the audience as well.\u201d\n\nSalonga is keeping the program\u2019s song selections a secret for now, until she and her musical director decide on the set list; however, she promises all of the tunes will be familiar and fit her vocal range. Some of the songs, she added, will be making their California debut.\n\n\u201cThis will be the first time for California audiences to hear these songs, but there is nothing unknown or out of left field; stuff that always makes sense with my voice.\u201d\n\nA regular feature of Salonga\u2019s solo concerts is an audience participation segment, in which she chooses someone to join her onstage to sing the Grammy and Academy Award-winning duet \u201cA Whole New World\u201d from \u201cAladdin.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo need to panic; we always have a lyric sheet so anyone who dares to come up doesn\u2019t have to have it memorized fully,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to have fun.\u201d\n\nSalonga has numerous Broadway credits, including her role as Eponine in the 1993 \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d Broadway run and as Fantine in the 2006 Broadway revival. She recently came off Broadway in the new musical \u201cAllegiance,\u201d which also starred George Takei and Telly Leung.\n\nSplitting her time between the U.S. and Manila, Salonga is a coach on the Philippine version of the television show \u201cThe Voice.\u201d In addition to her onscreen and onstage career, she has released several solo albums, including \u201cI\u2019d Like to Teach the World to Sing\u201d (1997) and \u201cBy Heart\u201d (1999).\n\nOn this tour, Grammy-nominated bass player Trey Henry and drummer Ray Brinker, both from the jazz group Tierney Sutton Band, will back Salonga.\n\n\u201cI get to go up onstage with musicians who I really admire and respect, and just have a great time with,\u201d Salonga said. \u201cIt\u2019s thrilling when I get to perform stuff where I can just emotionally let go and fly off to another world in my mind, and the audience gets to ride on that too.\u201d\n\nContact the writer: jmoe@ocregister.com"}, {"id": "gossipcop-771273", "label": 0, "text": "Ed Sheeran has come to a deal to end a $20 million copyright infringement lawsuit brought by two songwriters, Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, over his hit, \u201cPhotograph.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, court papers were filed dismissing the case with prejudice, but also stipulating that a California federal court would retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of an agreement.\n\nAlthough the parties including co-defendants Sony/ATV and Warner Music didn\u2019t disclose the nature of the settlement terms in a court filing, songwriting credits in the BMI database now have added Harrington and Leonard as co-authors along with Sheeran and Johnny McDaid. What\u2019s more, it appears that the two plaintiffs have gained a significant share of royalties. Before the lawsuit, 100 percent of the work was controlled by BMI, which administers the public performance of McDaid\u2019s works, but now that percentage has dropped to 82.5 percent as Leonard has an ASCAP affiliation.\n\nHarrington and Leonard, along with their publishing company HaloSongs, filed the lawsuit in June 2016, alleging that \u201cPhotograph\u201d derived from their 2009 work \u201cAmazing,\u201d which was recorded and released as a single by Matt Cardle, the winner of the 2010 season of the television competition show The X Factor.
