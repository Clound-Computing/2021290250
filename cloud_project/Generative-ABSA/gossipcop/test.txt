Despite a 47-year age difference, Caitlyn Jenner, 68, and Sophia Hutchins, 21, have been spending quite a bit of time together lately, and now, there are rumors that they may even be getting married! “They consider each other soul mates and freely admit they couldn’t imagine a life with anyone else at this point,” an insider tells RadarOnline. The site also reports that Caitlyn and Sophia are making “secret plans to tie the knot” and that Caitlyn is actually in a rush to get married again after her fallout with the Kardashian sisters.

“Cait has a wedding planner to handle all the details,” Radar’s source claims.”This is a dream come true for Cait because her rejection by the Kardashians had left her feeling isolated. Sophia has changed all that.” The ladies are reportedly planning their nuptials for this summer in Malibu. However, an insider tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY that reports of an engagement and upcoming wedding for Caitlyn and Sophia are “not true.”

It’s no secret that Caitlyn and Sophia have a very close relationship, though. Romance rumors first began in 2017, when the women were seen together in Mexico. Recently, they’ve been photographed out and about together quite a bit, although they’ve never confirmed any reports of a romance.

Like Caitlyn, Sophia is a transgender woman. She came out with her decision to transition in a 2016 article in her school newspaper at Pepperdine University. It is rumored that Sophia is living with Caitlyn in Malibu, with those reports fueled by several photos taken in Caitlyn’s home on Sophia’s Instagram page. The women recently attended the Erasing the Stigma Leadership Awards together on April 26, as well as the GLAAD Media Awards earlier that month.

I am devastated to report that Sofia Richie, 19, broke up with Scott Disick, 35, but the separation only lasted for two days. There have been a lot of conflicting reports about the state of the couple’s tortured relationship in the last week, but I trust the Kardashians’ official news network, E!, to have the most honest version of events.

E! reported yesterday that Richie ended things with Disick after he was spotted getting handsy with a “mystery blonde” at Kanye West’s album release party in Wyoming. (It’s interesting that Richie, who has been dating Disick for over a year — my God — wasn’t invited to the release party in the first place. I think that shows the Kardashians still have a long way to go in terms of accepting the relationship.) The breakup, however, lasted just 48 hours, as Disick quickly won Richie back with promises to “change.”

According to E!, Richie has been living at Disick’s house in L.A., but she stayed at her father Lionel Richie’s house during the short separation. “Lionel and her family encouraged the split and are very upset and disappointed that she decided to get back with him,” a source told the site.

Us Weekly reported last week that Lionel threatened to cut Sofia out of his will if she continued her relationship with Disick. But Sofia seems committed: She referred to Disick as her “whole [heart emoji]” on Instagram yesterday. Please pray that all relevant parties see reason soon.

Kendall Jenner, who once comically referred to Richie as one of Disick’s children, kissed someone in public. That someone is Anwar Hadid, the 18-year-old model brother of Jenner’s friends Gigi and Bella Hadid. TMZ got a photo of the pair making out at an after-party for the CFDAs Monday night. According to the gossip site, “Kendall was hangin’ with Anwar at Socialista New York for about 2 hours — kissing, cuddling and drinking with the youngest Hadid sibling the whole time.”

Will Gigi and Bella be upset? Who cares! Jenner never does anything fun, and this sounds fun. She also never shows PDA with anyone she reportedly dates. (Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, A$AP Rocky …) Maybe Anwar is the one.

Gigi Hadid, meanwhile, looks to be back together with her ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik. And Bella has been spotted hanging out several times with her ex-boyfriend the Weeknd. Everyone is happy.

In other new celeb relationship news, Jennifer Lawrence reportedly has a new boyfriend. According to “Page Six,” his name is Cooke Maroney, and he is a director at New York’s Gladstone Gallery. A source told the gossip site, “They met through Jen’s friend Laura … The relationship has been going on a few weeks. But they have been very private and careful not to be seen together.” This is exactly the thing a “source” would say before a new couple is about to be seen together. Keep your eyes on the Daily Mail!

“Page Six” says that Maroney is 33, which is great. It’s a nice age for a boyfriend to be, when you’re 27, which Lawrence is. A terrible age for a boyfriend to be is: 49.

One Small Blessing

“Audrina Patridge is the happiest she’s ever been since reuniting with Ryan Cabrera.”

Blind Item of the Week

And here’s an interesting blind item from this week, care of Enty at the best site for blind items, Crazy Days and Nights:

“I don’t think he acts enough any longer to be permanently A or A- list, but this former A+ list mostly movie actor cheated on his wife the night before they got married. He called it a cleanse. Uh huh.”

Who could it be? Richard Gere recently got married. So did Hugh Grant. Put your guess in the comments or speak it to the wind!

Finally, I’ll leave you with this photo of Emma Stone and Justin Theroux “hanging out” in a bungalow at the Hotel du Cap Eden Roc in the south of France last week. Both stars, who have been rumored to be dating since they left Rihanna’s Met Gala after-party together, were in town for the Louis Vuitton cruise show. Stone told reporters Theroux was like her “brother” at the show. Does this look like a brother-sister relationship to you? Let me know!

Tom Hiddleston, 36, was shocked to learn that Taylor Swift, 27, dropped some bars about their relationship on her new album, “Reputation“. But, come on, Tom; anyone’s fair game in Tay land. The singer referenced her ex on two tracks — “I Did Something Bad” and “Getaway Car”. And, since the pair didn’t split on bad terms [or so we thought], he was under the impression that he would’ve gotten a get out of fail free card when it was time for Tay to pen a new album.

“Tom was not expecting to be a part of Taylor’s album,” a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He thought they were on good terms,” our insider says, adding, “After their break-up, he was always asked if he was worried she was going to write about him, and he always said no. But everyone’s saying she did and he’s stunned. He genuinely thought he was going to get spared.” Well, maybe next time, Tom.

As soon as Taylor’s sixth studio album dropped, at midnight on Nov. 10, fans instantly began dissecting each and every lyric, as did we! And, here’s what we came up with. The first Tom reference came on her track, “I Did Something Bad”, which is actually about two men who made a mark on her 2016 year. The first verse is a nod to Kanye West, 40, where she sings about a “narcissist” who “talks sh-t.” Then, Tom came in. In the second verse, Tay sings about a “playboy” who she flew “around the world” with before she broke up with him. Well, she and Tom flew to Italy in the beginning stages of their relationship. Then, the song references to this man spending all of her money. And, when Tay and Tom were together, it was speculated that he was with her for her fame. So, you can decide.

The second Tom reference on “Reputation” came on the track, “Getaway Car”, which happens to be the only breakup song on the album. This track references both Tom and Calvin Harris, 33. In the beginning of the song, Taylor sings about wanting to get out of one relationship, but she doesn’t have a “reason.” Then, when she goes to an event where “the ties were black and the lights were white,” she found her reason — a new man, aka, Tom. In case you forgot, Taylor and Tom were first linked when they were seen together at the Met Gala… the home of black ties. Not long after the Met, she split with Calvin and ended up dating Tom. Coincidence? Nah. THEN, when the chorus comes around, Tay points out that the new relationship didn’t work out, and that the person [Tom] should’ve known how things would end, because of how they got together in the first place. And, again, you can decide. For a complete guide to every song and its hidden meaning, check out our full breakdown here.

Taylor and Tom were first linked at the Met Gala in 2016, as mentioned above. They even attended a pre-Met dinner at the home of Vogue‘s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, 68. Exactly one month later, she and Calvin split; and, two weeks after that, she and Tom were photographed in Rhode Island together. And, the rest was history, until they split just three months later in Sept. 2016.

HollywoodLifers, tell us, do you love Taylor’s new album?
Actress-filmmaker Angelina Jolie has reportedly made a Google alert on actor and estranged husband Brad Pitt's name to keep tabs on him

Brad Pitt, with ex-wife Angelina Jolie

Los Angeles: Actress-filmmaker Angelina Jolie has reportedly made a Google alert on actor and estranged husband Brad Pitt's name to keep tabs on him.

"Angelina wants to know exactly what Brad is up to at all times. To say she isn't able to move on would be an understatement," a source told hollywoodlife.com.

"She likes to always be in control and she knows that once the divorce is finalised she will have no hold over him any more. It's pretty sad really, seeing as she was the one who wanted the divorce in the first place. I suspect she was actually shocked he didn't try and fight more for her, her whole plan pretty much backfired," added the source.

Jolie decided to end the marriage in September. Since then, the two have been in divorce and custody battle.

Although the "Maleficent" actress is the one who wanted to split, she is "terrrified Brad will move on and find love with someone new".

"It's one of those she can't live with him, and she can't live without him, things. Brad and Angie had scorching chemistry and she just can't handle seeing him with another woman. She definitely gets very jealous."
The Mega Agency

Are Halle Berry and Keanu Reeves dating?

The two stars were photographed looking pretty chummy on the set of their new film “John Wick: Chapter 3,” sparking rumors they were seeing each other.

The Mega Agency Gossip Cop, however, reached out to a Berry source, who shut down the reports. The site also points out that Halle has only been on the NYC set for one day so far, which isn't much time to strike up a romance.

Meanwhile, Berry recently teased the movie's opening date on Instagram. She posted a note scrawled on paper from The Continental in NYC. The message said, “See you in a year, Mr. Wick,” and included the caption, “It's a date. 5.17.19.”

Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.
After periodical divorce gossip concerning the two has arrived every few years or so, one of the most creative rumors of the Carter matrimony is that a post-nuptial agreement has already been detailed down to a T. Agreements on how they will divvy up their riches, reportedly worth a combined net worth of $1 billion, “sources” claimed that they signed off on the financial arrangement in 2015 after hitting a rough patch in the marriage. Until an actual document surfaces, or at least an official statement from the Carters on the existence of it (we wouldn’t advise you hold your breath on that one), you can file this chitchat under null and void.
The Kardashian family feud raged on as the sisters disagreed about who should be invited to momager Kris Jenner‘s Christmas Eve party.

On Sunday night’s episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, things were still tense between Kim and Khloé and eldest sibling Kourtney.

“We really haven’t resolved anything with Kourtney since the therapy sessions. We have so much more to hash out,” Kim told the camera, adding that she felt like they were all “walking on egg shells.”

Making things worse? Kourtney didn’t want Scott Disick, the father of her three children, invited to Kris’ annual blowout — because then-boyfriend Younes Bendjima would be there.

“He’s still part of our family,” Kris insisted.

“What about my dad?” Kendall Jenner interjected, referring to Caitlyn Jenner, who’d fallen out with Kris and the Kardashian girls following the publication of her explosive memoir.

“Nobody thats coming would even know how to respond to her,” Kris argued, adding that she has a friendly relationship with Scott and wanted him present.

“Oh, you didn’t have a relationship with my dad for 25 years?” Kendall asked angrily.

But Kim and Khloé were on Scott’s side.

“I don’t care that Kourtney has a boyfriend. I have a girlfriend. i don’t give a s—,” he told them later. (He’s been dating Sofia Richie since the fall.)

Meanwhile, Kourtney found an ally in Kendall.

“It should be Younes going to the party and Scott coming to Christmas morning,” Kendall said, adding that it “blew my mind” how her mom and sisters didn’t recognize that banning Caitlyn yet welcoming Scott was hypocritical.

“Why is Scott coming to the party more important than my feelings?” Kourtney asked, mentioning that she was considering taking her kids out of town for the holiday to avoid drama.

“That’s not okay,” Khloé said when Kendall relayed the news.

“Do you think that’s like a cry for help, a cry for attention? Is she the new Rob?” Kim asked.

Kourtney brought Kendall to an ice-skating trip with her kids, and they discussed the rift further.

“You have to spend Christmas with us,” Kendall said.

“I just don’t know if we’re going to get along if we’re all in the same place,” Kourtney replied. “The meanness and stuff, it’s not worth it.”

Luckily, Kendall convinced her to stick around Calabasas. “I think you guys should make up and not worry about it, because it’s the holidays,” she said

And when Kourtney realized she wanted her kids to be around their cousins and aunts, she agreed.

So, she decided to talk to Scott directly about her concerns.

“I heard through the grapevine you’re the one person who doesn’t want me to go,” he said.

“I think that our lives are changing,” she said. “If my boyfriend is going to the party, if you’re there, I just don’t want any disrespect. I’ve been feeling super anxious … but I don’t want the kids to not have their dad there.”

In the end, Scott and Younes both attended, and even Caitlyn was invited, though she skipped out on the festivities.

“Not sharing this whole experience with my family and my kids, it wouldn’t have felt right,” Kourtney concluded, adding that getting in the Christmas spirit helped her resolve her issues with her sisters.
Life & Style has exclusively learned that George Clooney has recently made plans to move back to LA, for the safety of his family, after the latest spate of terror attacks in England.

“He doesn’t feel like Amal and the twins are safe living in the English countryside,” an insider says. “He’s determined to move his family to LA, where he feels much more secure.”

George’s safety concerns had been growing for years. The Oscar winner “has been subject to very serious threats in the past,” reveals the source, because of his humanitarian efforts in Darfur, Sudan. And Amal’s work as an international human rights lawyer, along with her public pleas for foreign governments to prosecute terrorists, has made her a potential target.

When George learned that he was going to be a father, those concerns went into overdrive. “As soon as Amal found out she was pregnant, he hired former Secret Service agents to assess all his properties and make recommendations for improvement,” the insider adds. “His mansion in Studio City [Calif.] was deemed the most secure, and it’s within minutes of an LAPD station.”

Charlie Sheen has slammed the woman who filed a lawsuit against him over unprotected sex. The actor called out his accuser and exposed her as a "hooker" who is extorting him after sleeping with many other men, reports TMZ.com.

Sheen is responding to the lawsuit filed anonymously last summer by a woman who says he had unprotected sex with her before revealing he’s HIV positive. In his documents Sheen says that Jane Doe is completely making that up. Sheen admits he showered her with money and gifts during their less than two-month-long relationship, however he adds that she not only extorted from him but also stalked him.
Jennifer Aniston's representative has denied reports in the US that the 47-year-old actress was pregnant.

The Friends actress married husband Justin Theroux last year.

"She is not pregnant," Aniston's spokesman said on Wednesday, according to the New York Post, adding that it was “just yet another” false claim about the actress.

InTouch magazine earlier on Wednesday quoted an unnamed friend of the couple as stating Aniston was pregnant.

"She and Justin are ecstatic. Jen has wanted to have a baby with Justin for years," the magazine claimed the friend said.

"Their baby news came at a bad time in her life, too — she just lost her mother, and she and Justin almost broke up. But now this surprise pregnancy has turned the worst of times into the best of times.”

Aniston's mother, Nancy Dow, died on May 25. She had suffered strokes in 2011 and 2012.

The magazine published pictures that it claimed showed Aniston had a "baby bump".

This is why I absolutely LOVE Blake Shelton! Not only does he burn Adam Levine all the time, but now he’s throwing it Luke Bryan’s way!

Turns out, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are just like other couples: they attend marriage counseling!

Sources tell Life & Style exclusively that after a six-week trial separation earlier this year, the famous duo wanted to salvage their relationship by seeking professional help. “Their therapist comes to their home and talks with them,” an insider reveals. “They were considering divorce, but decided to try to work it out. It’s been an uphill battle, but they’ve come a long way.”

The insider adds, “They’re learning how to communicate and understand each other. They have learned to get along again. The therapy is helping, for now.”

One of the things the pair addresses in their sessions is Kanye’s anger issues. “They discuss his different triggers and how Kim can keep him from getting upset at home,” a different source shares.

But while both stars have agreed to stay together, they differ in wanting a third baby. Kim, who has daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 18 months, with Kanye, is desperate to give her kids another sibling. As for Kanye… “He doesn’t want a third child,” the source admits, “but Kim thinks she’s found a way around that.”

The 36-year-old has been searching for a surrogate to carry their frozen embryo. “She wants to choose someone outside of the state of California, where there are all kinds of surrogacy laws,” the source says. “She’s ready to go.”

Kim previously revealed that it would be extremely dangerous for her to get pregnant again, given the complications she experienced during her last two deliveries. “Not only has this been really painful, but now hearing that I can’t carry any more kids, it couldn’t get any worse,” she said on an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

Two years ago Kim Kardashian attempted to bring down Taylor Swift when she tweeted ‘Wait it’s legit National Snake Day?!?!?They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days!’

Now the stuff of legend, the tweet led to Kimye fans bombarding Taylor’s social media accounts with the snake emoji and the pop star ended up going radio silent for nearly a year as she worked on her epic comeback album Reputation.

But Taylor has never been one to take anything lying down, and now fans believe she may have just thrown the most subtlest of epic shade as she has been pictured two years on wearing a snake-print backpack.

Tay has embraced the snake symbolism, coming back to social media after deleting years worth of content with three videos of snakes, using snake imagery on her tour merchandise and even riding a giant snake basket on the tour.

And now her new look has given fans life.

Just a casual backpack (Picture: Backgrid)

‘Excuse me while I scream about the fact that Taylor Swift is out in the open carrying a bag with a snakeskin print on the 2 year anniversary of the day Kimberly Kardashian called her a snake on social media and the internet sent her into hiding with #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty,’ tweeted one fan.

‘taylor swift stepping out of her apartment wearing a snake backpack and the same print she wore in a segment of the lwymmd music video on national snake day and the anniversary of kim kardashian’s shady tweet about her is the biggest power move i’ve ever seen (sic),’ said a second.

The women at the Cannes Film Festival made their voices heard at an extraordinary protest on the red carpet on Saturday evening, with Cate Blanchett, Kristen Stewart, Jane Fonda and Ava DuVernay among a group of 82 women standing in silent vigil ahead of a premiere at the Croisette.

Blanchett and French director Agnes Varda gave impassioned speeches in English and French, respectively.

“As women, we all face our own unique challenges, but we stand together on these stairs today as a symbol of our determination and commitment to progress,” read Blanchett and Varda’s statement.

“We will expect our institutions to actively provide parity and transparency in their executive bodies and safe environments in which to work. We will expect our governments to make sure that the laws of equal pay for equal work are upheld. We will demand that our workplaces are diverse and equitable so that they can best reflect the world in which we actually live. A world that allows all of us behind and in front of the camera to thrive shoulder to shoulder with our male colleagues.”

Moment historique de ce 71e @Festival_Cannes la “Montée des Femmes”. 82 Femmes du cinéma réunies sur les marches #Cannes2018 #Féminisme pic.twitter.com/aTO6sjekp2 – Citizen Cannes TV (@CITIZENCANNES) May 12, 2018

“We acknowledge all of the women and men who are standing for change. The stairs of our industry MUST be accessible to all. Let’s climb.”

Varda is one of only two women in Cannes Film Festival’s history to receive the Palme d’Or — the highest prize awarded — along with New Zealand filmmaker Jane Champion.

The group stood on the steps of the Palais des Festival silently to protest how hard it still is to climb the ladder as a woman in Hollywood. The protests, part of the rising 5050×2020 movement was planned ahead of the premiere of “Girls of the Sun,” a film in competition by director Eva Husson, one of only three female filmmakers in the running.

That is an improvement over Cannes’ historical record. Only 82 films in official selection in the history of the Cannes Film Festival have been directed by women. The number of women participating in the protest was selected to match this figure.

Others involved in the vigil are Salma Hayek, Marion Cotillard, director Patty Jenkins and Haifaa al-Mansour, and agents including CAA’s Hylda Queally and activist-journalist Melissa Silverstein.

DuVernay and Stewart are on the jury. Fonda is at the festival for the screening of a documentary about her life.

Silverstein told TheWrap that the protest originated with the French group Le Deuxieme Regard and the 5050×2020 collective, working directly with the festival.

“They get all the credit,” said Silverstein. “I am honored to work with them to amplify the message about the need for more women in the competition at the festival. This feels like a very big moment.”

On the 5050×2020 website, the organization released a statement echoing many of those given by women involved in the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements in Hollywood, noting how the downfall of producer Harvey Weinstein has triggered a demand for change and calling for the French film industry to confront that demand.

“While French cinema wasn’t shaken by the Weinstein shock wave, it is essential that we move to take concrete action reaching beyond the issue of sexual abuse alone,” the site’s statement reads.

“We believe that the distribution of power needs to be questioned. We believe that equality restores the balance of power. We believe that diversity deeply changes representations. We believe that the opportunity to work in an egalitarian and inclusive environment must be seized because we are certain that the equal sharing of power will promote profound creative renewal.”

As TheWrap reported recently, the statistics for women in Cannes are pretty dismal: Over the first 71 years, a paltry 4.3 percent of the competition films have been directed by women. (See chart below.) Only one, Jane Campion’s “The Piano,” has won the Palme d’Or, though actresses Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux were given honorary Palmes alongside “Blue Is the Warmest Color” director Abdellatif Kechiche’s real one in 2013.

Admittedly, things are getting better. Of the 11 times that three or more women have placed films in competition, eight have come in the last 13 years. Three women made the cut in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 — and four did so in 2011.

This year along with Husson, the women in competition include Nadine Labaki with “Capharnaum” and Alice Rohrwacher with “Happy as Lazzaro.”
Brad Pitt is balancing work with fatherhood.

The 54-year-old actor was snapped on the Los Angeles set of his new film with Leonardo DiCaprio, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, on Monday, rocking a denim-on-denim outfit. A source tells ET that Pitt has been busy filming the highly anticipated Quentin Tarantino crime drama set in 1969, but also spending time with his kids.

According to the source, Pitt's kids with estranged wife Angelina Jolie have been spending time with the actor at his Los Feliz, California, home, and that there's "a lot of laughter and skating" around the house.

Last month, Pitt and 43-year-old Jolie struck a new custody agreement when it comes to their six children. According to court documents obtained by ET, Jolie was ordered by a judge to help repair her children's relationship with Pitt. A judge determined that the kids "not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them," and the actor will now have more time with his minor children -- 14-year-old Pax, 13-year-old Zahara, 12-year-old Shiloh and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne -- over the summer, while 16-year-old Maddox, "because of his age and maturity," can determine how much time he wants to spend with his father.

In keeping with the new custody agreement, Pitt has been with the children since July 21 and will have them through July 29, before he is responsible for getting the kids back to London to be with Jolie. Pitt must arrange for visits with doctors and a therapist during his time with the kids, while Jolie is only allowed to call the kids once per day at a time agreed in advance by both parents.

Late last month, a source told ET that Pitt is looking to improve his co-parenting relationship with Jolie, and is choosing fatherhood over dating.

"Brad was taking time to date, when he had the time. He also enjoyed quietly dating," the source said. "But now all he wants to do is focus on family. He has taken a step away from dating because of the importance of his children and also to help mend fences with Angelina."

"[He and Angelina] still don't get along at all, and in fact, they can barely be in the same room," the source added. "Brad doesn't want to rock the boat [by dating]. He wants to try to co-parent and the last thing he needs right now is to start another war because things seem smoother than they've ever been."

President Donald Trump has broken his silence on the James Comey hearing, declaring that the nearly three hours of Senate testimony from the former FBI director on Thursday amounted to “total and complete vindication” of his actions after winning the election in November.

Trump sent a tweet at 6:10 a.m. ET that also criticized Comey for his admission that he leaked information to the media via an intermediary in an effort to force the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of collusion during the 2016 election cycle between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials. Comey’s gambit worked as another former FBI director, Robert Mueller, was named last month as a special counsel to the Justice Department to lead an independent probe.

There had been speculation that President Trump would offer his commentary on Comey’s testimony in real time on Twitter, but he waited until early Friday morning to weigh in.

“Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication…and WOW, Comey is a leaker!” the President wrote.

Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication…and WOW, Comey is a leaker! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2017

Thursday’s hearing transfixed much of the nation as Comey answered questions from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee about his dealings with Trump and his assertion that Trump pressured him to drop his investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his ties to Russian officials. The Senate is investigating the broader question of Russian interference in the U.S. election. Trump and his associates have strongly denied there was any such collusion.

Comey, who was fired by Trump on May 9, repeatedly stated that Trump has lied in his accounts of their interactions. He blasted the President and members of his administration for what he described as a campaign to “defame” him and the FBI. Comey also asserted there was no doubt that the Russian government directed a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 election through hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s email system as well as through other cyber-malfeasance.

“There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever, the Russians interfered in our election,” Comey said.

The Comey has hearing generated a tidal wave of media coverage and analysis that will undoubtedly continue for many days. About 45 minutes after his tweet about the hearing, Trump sent another message praising Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” morning show, which is known to be among his favorite news programs.
Jonah Hill and Emma Stone are donning some radical attire while shooting their new Netflix series, Maniac — but the former Wolf of Wall Street star’s weight loss continues to steal the show.

While the La La Land actress, 28, looked different while sporting a curly blonde wig and high-waisted acid-washed jeans on the set of the ’80s comedy, Hill was nearly unrecognizable with a mullet and shorts that showed off his lean legs while filming a scene in New York City on Friday, August 25.

Whether it’s assuming the downward dog position, hitting the pavement or lifting weights, stars enjoy shedding pounds with their famous acquaintances by their side. Reese Witherspoon, for example, goes on hikes with her […]

The Superbad costars are currently shooting the dark comedy about an inpatient at a mental institution who lives out his adventures while dreaming. Justin Theroux also has a role in the 10-episode series, which is based on a 2014 Norwegian show.

Hill’s weight has gone up and down dramatically over the past few years. The comedic actor became a household name in 2007 when he starred in Superbad as an overweight high school student. In 2011, he famously lost 40 pounds before appearing in Moneyball with Brad Pitt.

The Oscar nominee then had to gain 40 pounds for 2015’s War Dogs, only to subsequently slim down with the help of 21 Jump Street costar Channing Tatum.

“I wanted to get in better shape, so I called Channing Tatum and said, ‘Hey, if I ate less and go to a trainer, will I get in better shape?'” Hill told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show in 2016. “And [Tatum] said, ‘Yes, you dumb motherf–ker, of course, you will. It’s the simplest thing in the entire world.”

Hill has credited eating clean, including a Japanese food diet, and not drinking beer as the reason for his weight loss. He also kept a food journal (which he accidentally emailed to Drake) while working with a nutritionist.
In the aftermath of Justin Bieber’s quickie engagement to Hailey Baldwin, and his light-on-the-punctuation celebratory Instagram on the matter, all eyes seemed to turn expectantly to Selena Gomez and collectively ask in a sing-songy voice: “Are you okay?” This is only natural, given that she is one-half of the couple formerly known as Jelena, and had dated Bieber on and off since 2010—back when he used to have a bowl cut and wear his favorite color, purple, all the time. The concern was especially palpable since Bieber and Gomez had been together as recently as a few months ago, only reportedly breaking up in March.

However, as much as the tabloid-consuming public loves a love triangle and salivates over the idea of a woman scorned, I’m going to go out on a limb and say that if there’s anyone we should be worried about right now, it would not be Selena Gomez. Beliebers may not be fine—whether because they wanted to marry Bieber themselves or because they longed for Bieber and Gomez to end up together at last—but something tells me Selena Gomez is more than fine herself. And not just because she stepped out looking perfectly happy in new hair extensions this week or because a source bluntly told Us Weekly: “Selena doesn’t care.”

For one, Gomez was always the more mature, has-her-shit-together member of the relationship. She was never the one getting arrested for a DUI in a rented Lamborghini in Miami. She has never urinated in a restaurant mop bucket. She has, especially by child Disney star–turned–teen pop idol standards, largely skirted controversy and scandal. And perhaps she is not the spontaneous, splashy engagement type either, which may be why she is no longer with someone who clearly is. All good thoughts to Bieber and Baldwin, but statistically speaking, drawing on the history of young celebrity engagements, Gomez is probably not the person we should be concerned about here.

Furthermore, for Selena Gomez, marrying Justin Bieber could very possibly feel akin to marrying your high school boyfriend at age 25, which a lot of people, in 2018, simply do not want to do. The long—so long—history of their relationship was absolutely part of what made people root for them, but it could always be a valid deal-breaker. “It was never a healthy situation for Selena and Justin,” a source tells People. A “Bieber pal” echoed to the magazine: “Their relationship was always very complex and complicated. It was just too much baggage.”
Alexandra Daddario, 32, wants to make something very clear: She’s not dating Zac Efron. Yes, he was her love interest in the 2017 Baywatch film but the actress claims that, in real life, they’re just “good friends.” Alexandra clarified their relationship in an interview with PEOPLE. Crushing the hopes of Baywatch fans everywhere, she said on May 31, “We’re very good friends. Zac and I’ve worked together, and we’re very good friends.”

It’s not the first time that Alexandra has claimed that Zac, 30, is in the friendship zone. In May 2017, she told E! News, “We work together closely; he’s my love interest in the film. I understand why people would go crazy over something like that, but Zac and I are very good friends.” So, what happened? Alexandra’s comments don’t match what HollywoodLife and other outlets have been told about the status of her relationship with Zac. In April a source EXCLUSIVELY told us that the actress has been “very coy” about their rumored romance. The person added, “But people that are close to her know that this a defense mechanism because she really wants it to work and doesn’t want anything to get in the way of a great love match. She wants to make it look like she is single in public but is 100 percent all about Zac and the relationship they are brewing.”

If we take Alexandra at her word, she and Zac have definitely – at the very least – formed their own mutual admiration society. On March 16, he posted a tribute to the actress on his Instagram page. Next to a photo of them together, he wished her a “Happy Birthday” calling her the, “most real, down to earth, stunning, intelligent, creative, loving and most rare Pokemon ever created.” And on April 4, when Alexandra posted a photo of her looking at her dog on Instagram, he commented, “Two hot b*tches.” Because, with flirting like that, of course people wouldn’t think they’re dating. Right?
President Donald Trump is causing an uproar again this morning after a bizarre interview where he praised President Andrew Jackson and questioned the reason behind the Civil War. His remarks were from a radio conversation with Sirius XM's Salena Zito on Monday morning.

"I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little later you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was a really tough person, but he had a big heart," Trump said, despite the fact that Jackson was behind Native American removal, the Trail of Tears and owned about 150 slaves.

"He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, 'There's no reason for this,'" Trump added. Jackson died in 1845. The Civil War began in 1861.

"People don't realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why?," he added, seeming to forget the basic curriculum of an American history class. "People don't ask that question, but why was there a Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?" Hint: slavery. Another hint: "states' rights."

Listen to the exchange here:

The quote sent Twitter in a frenzy. Here's what some people had to say:
It's been a busy few months for the Kardashian/Jenner family. With pregnancy rumors a-swirling and just about every sister involved romantically with somebody, it was only a matter of time before Kendall Jenner jumped into a new relationship. People are wondering how Kendall Jenner and Blake Griffin met, and it's like... I don't know, you guys. How does ANYONE meet a famous supermodel and reality TV star and/or professional athlete? My guess is someone's "people" called the other person's "people" and set up a lunch date like I've read about in old-timey novels, but then again, I'm not famous. I literally have no idea how things work.

All I know is Jenner has been to at least four basketball games to catch Griffin play with his team, the Los Angeles Clippers, and they've had a few dinners together. If that doesn't shout "MAYBE THEY'RE BECOMING A 'THING'" I literally don't know what else does.

Jenner and Griffin were first linked together back in September of 2017 when they went out for dinner in New York City. The two dined at a spot called Carbone (bone... hehehe) and reportedly saw the movie It. I mean, a swanky Italian dinner followed by a scary movie? Sounds like a good ol' fashioned high school date night to me. Since then, Jenner has been regularly attending his games and even celebrated her 22nd birthday with him.

E! reports that Jenner partied on her big day with family and friends at a taqueria in Los Angeles and that she and Griffin arrived separately. Still, an insider says the two spent the entire evening together. The source added, "They weren't overly affectionate, but they spent a lot of time talking closely and dancing."

Maybe that's because most of Jenner's family was there, including family matriarch Kris Jenner, Corey Gamble, Kim and Kanye West, and Caitlyn Jenner.

Another source told People magazine that they started dating casually, but now things are picking up. The source said,

Kendall is very happy with Blake. They started out more like friends, and then it was very casual. But it seems more serious lately. When they are not together, they keep in touch over the phone. Her family has accepted Blake. They are spending time getting to know him.

Yet another insider told US Weekly that the pair is "full on," claiming,

They’re legit. They’re a full-on couple. Kendall has been going to a lot of his games and they have been enjoying time at home when Blake is in town. They’re good.

Not for nothing, Griffin sounds like a pretty awesome guy. While he was once named One Of The Greatest Rookies Of All Time by Sports Illustrated, you might have also caught him flexing some comedy chops on the hit series Broad City. Griffin has somewhat of an affinity for comedy, and has even performed at Montreal's mega-comedy festival Just For Laughs. He also co-parents two kids, ages one and four, with his ex, Brynn Cameron, which Griffin says has changed a lot for him.

He told the Los Angeles Times,

Now it’s like what kind of example am I leaving or setting for my son... When my daughter can actually know what’s going on? What type of example am I showing her about how she should expect to be treated by men and all those things...

He added, "Like, that’s the biggest thing … I spend my time a little different and I think a little differently."

Spend your time a little different like... hanging out with Kendall Jenner all the time? We totally get it.

Portia de Rossi believes that people’s perceptions of same-sex marriage changed for the better when she tied the knot with Ellen DeGeneres in 2008. But some negativity ensued, too.

“The divorce rumors came and then we really knew the perceptions had changed,” the Arrested Development star, 45, told Us Weekly exclusively at the General Public x RH Celebration in West Hollywood on Wednesday, June 27. “I’m not kidding. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when that started happening I thought, ‘Oh, now we’re finally accepted.’ We get the same s–t as every celebrity couple.”

Split rumors aren’t the only ones that de Rossi has faced. “I thought, ‘Wow, this is great that I’m pregnant, not pregnant, divorced, not divorced, whatever,” she added. “That means there is an acceptance for this.”

The actress said she and DeGeneres, 60, don’t necessarily laugh off the speculation. In fact, they try to ignore it completely.

“I was at a newsstand … and there was a cover of Brad [Pitt] and Jen [Aniston],” she recalled. “I literally just stared at it, and I was like, ‘They haven’t seen each other. … How is this even a thing? I know for a fact.’ … I actually took a picture of it and sent it to Ellen and said, ‘Can you believe this?’ Anyway, no, in other words, we avoid it. We don’t care.”

De Rossi also spoke with Us about launching The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund in honor of her wife’s birthday in January. “All of it was a complete surprise, which was very difficult. It was so difficult to keep it from her,” she said. “She’s so observant. I literally had to take my email address off all of our shared devices at home … because I knew that if she saw an email coming in from Africa, it would be all over. She would put it all together.”

The philanthropist explained that she wanted to do something special for the TV host’s milestone day. “I thought this was a big birthday, 60, and she’s not going to do her talk show forever, and I want her to be able to look forward to retiring, to know that there was something the entertainment industry that she could sink her teeth into,” she told Us. “It was those two things.”

In addition, de Rossi opened up about how her company, General Public, partnered with Restoration Hardware. “I’m an art lover and collector. I wouldn’t call myself an expert, I’m just a fan,” she said. “I saw the disparity between the quality of art that you can get in the fine art market and decorative art that is available to most people. I just thought that it was kind of a shame that you have to be extremely interested in art — or interested enough to go to an art gallery or learn the art market — in order to get a better quality of art than what is available. I really wanted to bridge the gap a little and just introduce more artists into this kind of vortex in between and really support them because most of the art that you see that’s available at retail is made by graphic designers or computer generated. I wanted actual artists to be able to share their work.”
Brad Pitt is reportedly dismissing ex Angelina Jolie's claim that she's hurting for money as their bitter divorce battle continues. According to The Blast, Pitt is scoffing at Jolie's alleged financial woes -- because she was just paid more than $20 million for her role in Maleficent 2!

The actors are embroiled in a vicious court feud over their divorce and custody of their six kids. As RadarOnline.com has reported, in the past week, legal papers have shown that Jolie, 43, accused Pitt, 54, of not paying her enough child support over the past two years.
They divorced more than a decade ago, but people are still talking about Jen's response to Brad's shock split

Jennifer Aniston 'knew it was a matter of time before ex-husband Brad Pitt split from Angelina Jolie'

Jennifer Aniston "knew it was a matter of time" before her ex husband Brad Pitt split from Angelina Jolie, it has been claimed.

Angelina filed for divorce from Brad yesterday, citing irreconcilable differences.

As news of the split broke, people turned their attention towards Jennifer, whose marriage to Brad disintegrated shortly after he met Angelina on the set of their movie Mr & Mrs Smith in 2005.

"Jennifer always knew this day would come," a source told New York Post's Page Six. "Everyone in Jennifer's inner circle regards Angelina as a crazy master manipultor.

"But we all presumed the end of their affair would be Angelina leaving Brad for someone else."

The source claimed Jen, who is now happily married to Justin Theroux, still wants the best for her ex, but could be quietly marking the end of Brad's marriage with friends.

"Jen still cares about Brad and wishes him well. She has moved on and is really happy with Justin Theroux.

"She's probably having a margarita with Courteney Cox right now."

Ang and Brad share children Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, eight.

Brad broke his silence after news of the divorce was revealed yesterday to say he felt "very saddened".

In a statement, he said: "I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the wellbeing of our kids."

Angelina's manager also insisted her decision was made in the "best interest" of the couple's children.

Geyer Kosinki said: "Angelina is doing what's best in the interest of taking care of her children. She appreciates everyone's understanding of their need for privacy at this time."

And entertainment attorney Robert Offer added: "Angelina has filed for dissolution of the marriage. This decision was made for the health of the family.

"She will not be commenting, and asks that the family be given its privacy at this time."
Everyone is always talking about Kim Kardashian. Whether she's supporting Kanye West in his latest debacle or sharing pictures of her cute kids, the woman and her family make their rounds on the internet. This time, the brave reality star shared a shocking video of herself in complete disarray. The video of Kim Kardashian having a panic attack is frightening and heartbreaking, but nonetheless, honest and brave because she allowed camera crews to document it.

According to a report from BuzzFeed, in an upcoming episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim K arrives at a house in Mexico with several of her close friends and grows increasingly more uncomfortable and anxious. She begins having severe flashbacks of her Paris robbery incident, and the post traumatic stress sets in. Kim K called her friend and the owner of the house, Joe Francis, hysterically crying, saying, "Are you sure it's safe here? ... I’m just like, why did I come, you know?"

On the other line, her friend reassures her. "Yeah, I promise you. Look, I went through the same thing and I promise you, it's safe. I have my kids there."

Kim explains the traumatic ordeal in a confessional interview on KUWTK,

Ever since Paris, I just go through this worst-case scenario mode in my head. I was so excited to come on this trip and I had no idea that I was gonna end up feeling this way.

Kim K also explained,

But it hit me right as we were getting off the plane that all of these people at the airport are going to see you know, 17 or 18 girls with all of our Chanel bags and Louis Vuitton this, and it just like hit me: We’re the biggest target ever."

Since Kim K's robbery in Paris back in 2016, the reality star has shared her battle with anxiety and her struggles from it. She told Ellen DeGeneres in an interview from April of 2017 that she has sleeping issues at night, unless there's a security guard outside of her door and present at her residence. She said,

My whole life has changed. I never thought I would need security staying outside of my door. I should have had a security guard outside of my door. Now I have several just for me to be able to sleep at night.

Back in April, Kim K suffered another bout with anxiety on an episode of KUWTK. The business mogul decided to finally leave the house to attend a Kanye West concert, but within minutes suffered from a panic attack. She began having terrible anxiety and had to rush out of the auditorium. She said in a confessional on the show,

I just want to disappear for a little bit. I have to do what makes me feel comfortable.

Kim K was robbed at gunpoint by two masked men in her hotel room in Paris in October of 2016. The men reportedly stole $10 million dollars worth of jewelry and tied up the Kardashian star. She was unharmed, but severely shaken.

Although the entire Kardashian family is severely judged by every move they make, it's important to remember they are human, too. Kim K appears to have it all together on the outside, but on the inside she's just like the millions of other people who suffer from panic attacks and anxiety disorders daily. Those who go through it know how deeply traumatic it can feel. That's why Kim's brave documentation of her anxiety attack is important to showcase and to remember. It's proof we all struggle... even Kim Kardashian.

Mary Tyler Moore, the beloved television icon who rose to fame in the ’60s on The Dick Van Dyke Show and later shattered the glass ceiling for women on television as the star of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, died Wednesday at 80.

In the wake of her death, celebrities paid tribute to the actress on social media, mourning the seven-time Emmy winner with a series of heartfelt posts.

“A great lady I loved and owe so much to has left us,” wrote her former co-star Ed Asner. “I will miss her. I will never be able to repay her for the blessings that she gave me.”

In a statement to EW, Moore’s costar from 1967’s Thoroughly Modern Millie, Julie Andrews, called her a “very dear friend.”

“We bonded instantly on the film,” Andrews said, “and laughed our way through the production. Ever since that time, we never referred to each other again as Julie and Mary. Whenever we bumped into each other, people must have thought us nuts…screaming across some shopping aisle in a supermarket or yelling to each other down the corridors of CBS…’Millie! Miss Dorothy!'”

“She was a joy to work with, her talent was monumental. She was brave, kind, generous and an activist for many causes,” Andrews continued. “I will miss my ‘Miss Dorothy’ so much, but I’m comforted to know that the joy she brought us all will be everpresent in her many films and television shows.”

Moore’s friend Larry King also expressed his condolences, tweeting, “Mary Tyler Moore was a dear friend and a truly great person. A fighter. Rest in peace, MTM.”

Selena Gomez’s close friend Francia Raisa is opening up about the "depression” the pair suffered after she donated her kidney to the 25-year-old pop star as part of her treatment for lupus.

Raisa, 29, made the remarks to Self in a video clip that was published on Wednesday. Gomez, she said, told her over FaceTime she was a match.

“And I’m like, ‘Yay... what? How do you know this?’” the “Grown-ish” actress said. “I had a way that I wanted to tell her when I made the decision. I knew it was gonna happen, I just needed that time, like it’s a big thing.”

She continued, “So I hang up, and I call my social worker, and I’m angry. And she told me, ‘It’s gonna be hard: the recipient is gonna glow, and she’s gonna recover a lot faster than the donor is ‘cause she’s receiving something she needs. You’re losing something you don’t need to lose. It’s gonna be hard.’ And it was very hard. Selena and I both went through a depression.”

SELENA GOMEZ IS TAKING A BREAK FROM FAME AFTER JUSTIN BIEBER BREAKUP, REPORT SAYS

Gomez, according to Raisa, “had some complications with hers, and she’s bigger scars, than you know, I do.”

Raisa said that Gomez texted her, “I’m so scared I might die.”

“I was like, 'What?' And I - I was calling someone and that’s when when she got the complication where the kidney turned and broke an artery,” Raisa revealed. “And she had to go back in and they actually had to take a vein out of her leg, so she has a scar right here, and um, build a wall around her artery.”

Gomez also opened up about her battle with depression in an interview with Harper's Bazaar in early February.

"[Depression is] not something I feel I’ll ever overcome," Gomez told the magazine. "There won’t be a day when I’m like, 'Here I am in a pretty dress— I won!' I think it’s a battle I’m gonna have to face for the rest of my life, and I’m okay with that because I know that I’m choosing myself over anything else."

The singer has been very open about her life-saving transplant.

“As soon as I got the kidney transplant, my arthritis went away,” the singer told TODAY in October. “My lupus -- there’s about a 3-5 percent chance it'll ever come back. My blood pressure is better. My energy, my life has been better.”

Gomez praised Raisa during an acceptance speech for the Billboard Woman of the Year Award in November 2017.

"I think Francia should be getting this award. She saved my life … I feel incredibly lucky,” she said at the time.
Justin and his arms went on a coffee date (picture: film magic)

What breakup?

Justin Theroux looked to have been hitting the gym big time when he was spotted with a couple tickets to the gun show.

While we’re sure he wasn’t banking on being spotted, as he headed out with a companion on a coffee date last week in New York, there was no going incognito when you’re sporting biceps the size of the Big Apple.

One could say he’s simply living.his.best.life.

The Tropic Thunder star grinned and joked around as he walked his bike around the city with an aptly-described ‘mystery brunette’.

Justin strode alongside a pal (picture: The Mega Agency)

The 42-year-old could have worn a tidy turtleneck to disguise said guns, but instead he proudly showed them off in an Eazy-E tank.

Standard.

While there’s much speculation about the dating life of the producer and writer, following his split with wife Jennifer Aniston (and, of her’s too #equality), all eyes were on those bulging muscles as we all quickly scheduled a lunchtime yoga session, following by a weights class, just to try and emulate some sort of tone to mimic Justin’s.

Since his split from wife Jen – after the two got married in a secret ceremony in 2015 – Justin has also been linked to artist Petra Collins and actress Aubrey Plaza.

Maybe he’s just got a lot of friends, eh?

When it came to Aubrey, according to The Sun, the duo were just friends and the publication claimed that there was nothing romantic between them, after they were spotted returning to Justin’s apartment.

Jen and Justin split earlier this year (picture: Jim Smeal/REX/Shutterstock)

An insider close to the comedian said: ‘Aubrey and Justin are just friends and were simply meeting up to talk about potential work projects. There’s nothing more to it.’

According to reports, Justin has been busy ‘doing his thing’ in New York, while Aniston remained in LA.

A source told People: ‘Now, he’s apparently just enjoying the single life in New York and sticking to a pretty basic routine. He’s just doing his thing. He eats at the same time, goes to the same places, hangs with the same people.’

Celebrity tweets rolled in Thursday afternoon after a Nevada parole board granted O.J. Simpson an early release from jail. The infamous former football player and entertainment personality was incarcerated in 2008 after being found guilty on robbery and kidnapping charges and has been held at Lovelock Correctional Facility in Nevada ever since. The early release will end his sentence of nine-to-33 years, and Simpson could walk free as soon as Oct. 1.

In 1995, after a heavily publicized and scrutinized trial that has spawned several dramatizations and documentaries, Simpson was acquitted for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and friend, Ronald Goldman.

A second source said that Thompson has been “overcome with emotion” and “everything changed when Khloe gave birth.” The insider added that he “is hoping that Khloe will choose to stay in Cleveland with their daughter, but isn’t going to make any demands of her to do so.”
The two haven't even been dating a year but the transgender star is already spending the big bucks to keep her gal pal sweet . "Caitlyn is spending an absolute fortune on Sophia," dished a source.

As previously reported, Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, announced their separation on Thursday, February 15, via a joint statement: “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”

The duo, who started dating in May 2011, tied the knot in August 2015. While it was Theroux’s first marriage, Aniston was married to Pitt, 54, from 2000 to 2005. He infamously moved on from the Friends alum with his Mr. and Mrs. Smith costar, Angelina Jolie. Pitt and Jolie, who share Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11 and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, called it quits in September 2016 after two years of marriage and 12 years together.

The 18-year-old star and the Canada-born rapper were caught kissing and 'making out' at Drizzy's Memorial Day house party on Monday, May 30.

Jun 1, 2016

AceShowbiz - Things between Kylie Jenner and PARTYNEXTDOOR seem to be heating up. The two fueled rumors that they're dating after they were caught getting cozy at Drake's Memorial Day house party on Monday, May 30.

A woman who also attended the party took to social media to reveal that the 18-year-old star and the Canadian rapper got affectionate during the party. She said that the two were acting like a couple as they mingled with some friends.

At one point, the "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" star and the 22-year-old musician were seen kissing and making out. "They were all over each other, kissing and making out," said the source. "It was almost like she was trying to make a statement."

Another source told HollywoodLife.com, "Kylie was cute. She had this air about herself the way she was swinging her hair and walking about at the pool. She definitely thought she was the s*** and was tugging onto PND like he was the hottest dude at the party. He had his hand on her ass the whole time."

"Honestly, most of the girls there were older than her and didn't care about her," the source continued. "She must have felt that energy and that's when she turned it up a notch, twerking on PND, kissing on him; and at one point he even picked her up while kissing her. They got their life at the party. They really did."

Kylie sparked rumors that she had a romantic relationship with the rapper just days after she broke up with Tyga. On Saturday, the LipKit founder posted on Snapchat a video of PND playing a piano as he sang, "Kylie oh Kylie."

The video came one day after Kylie accused PND of hiding her because he previously uploaded a video of themselves going bowling and imediately deleted it. "You not only hide me, you delete me," Kylie said in a video. "No I don't man, I'm protecting you," PND responded.

The Duchess of Cambridge is said forbidding her husband to travel alone as she's allegedly furious after seeing all pictures and videos that emerged from his recent ski trip to Switzerland.

Apr 1, 2017

AceShowbiz - It seems that Kate Middleton is now having trust issues with Prince William following his recent flirty ski trip to Switzerland. The Duchess of Cambridge is said forbidding him from solo travel as she's allegedly furious after seeing all pictures and videos that emerged from the ski trip.

National Enquirer is the first to claim that Kate refuses to let William travel alone, blaring an alarming headline, "Kate Puts Wild William On A Short Leash." The publication goes on citing a so-called source as saying, "Kate was furious when she saw the pictures. These boys-only skiing trips are a thing of the past."

"Kate wears the trousers in their marriage," the alleged insider further purports, before adding that the mother of 3-year-old George and 1-year-old Charlotte found her husband's behavior "humiliating and William will be made to pay."

No Kensington Palace reps have responded to the news. As reported before, Prince William skipped a Commonwealth Day service to enjoy a lads-only holiday. He was partying with his pals Guy Pelly, James Meade and Tom van Straubenzee at a club in Verbier, Switzerland on Monday, March 13.

The second in line to the throne in England was rumored cheating on his wife Kate after he was spotted "having a cozy lunch" with Aussie-born model Sophie Taylor during the ski trip. The two were reportedly drinking beer, wine and Jagerbombs at the Verbier resort. They were also pictured high-fiving.

Angelina Jolie abruptly split from her partner of 12 years and husband of two, Brad Pitt, in September 2016. But their divorce still isn’t final, a new report says, because they still haven’t agreed to terms about their six children. It has been almost two years since Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced their split.(Shutterstock)

According to E! News, Jolie is resentful of Pitt for essentially locking her down in Los Angeles, because he’s chosen a film that will be shot in LA to be near his kids. Jolie, meanwhile, had planned on taking them to Europe. “Brad is opposed to that and is blocking it from happening. Brad will be filming in LA for the summer and wants to see the kids on his regular custody schedule,” a source told E.

He currently sees his children - Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne - a few times a week. Jolie, according to the report, is ‘furious’ at the situation.

Jolie recently took Shiloh and Zahara to Jordan to visit a refugee camp in January, and later travelled to Paris with all of her children. “Angelina has been in London and is free to travel for shorter periods of time,” the source says. “Brad isn’t opposed to that. But she can’t leave with the kids for several months.”

Jolie had initially filed for sole physical custody of the kids, but in November 2016, Pitt filed for joint custody. By December, they’d reached a temporary agreement, after the FBI concluded their investigation of Pitt regarding an alleged incident of child abuse on a private plane. No charges were filed and Pitt was cleared.

Pitt opened up about the custody battle in his 2017 interview to GQ Style, his first since the split. “I was really on my back and chained to a system when Child Services was called,” he said. “And you know, after that, we’ve been able to work together to sort this out. We’re both doing our best. I heard one lawyer say, ‘No one wins in court—it’s just a matter of who gets hurt worse.’ And it seems to be true, you spend a year just focused on building a case to prove your point and why you’re right and why they’re wrong, and it’s just an investment in vitriolic hatred. I just refuse. And fortunately my partner in this agrees. It’s just very, very jarring for the kids, to suddenly have their family ripped apart.”

An US Weekly report goes on to say that Pitt is committed to staying in LA, even if that means staying away from his rumoured new girlfriend, the MIT professor, Neri Oxman. “Brad and Neri are still very much in each other’s lives, although not as much as he would like,” the US Weekly source said.

But without even a draft of the settlement being written by either side, it just goes to show ‘how at odds they continue to be,’ the report continued.

Sandra Bullock is opening up about her current views on marriage after adopting her second child (a little girl named Laila!)

When asked if she could see herself getting married again, the 51-year-old Oscar winner responded, “I don’t think so, but I can see myself in a committed, safe relationship where there is lots of love and laughter, and ‘making memories’ is No. 1 on the to-do list.”

Sandra is reportedly currently dating photographer Bryan Randall (who actually photographed the cover story spread for People mag’s reveal).

Sandra also was asked if her family, including son Louis, 5, was traditional.

“If a traditional home is one that is filled with lots of love and poop jokes, no sleep, schedule books filled with more kids’ social events than adults’ and lots of yelling over who touched who first … then I have a very traditional family,” Sandra added.

Pictured inside: Sandra‘s boyfriend Bryan out on a photo shoot in Hollywood on Sunday (December 6).

Many celebrities have been sharing their thoughts on Hurricane Irma, which is expected to cause extensive damage to Florida after wreaking havoc in the Caribbean.

Last night, "Extra's" AJ Calloway caught up with Rihanna, who expressed sadness over Hurricane Irma. She said, "My family is safe, Barbados is very safe right now. It breaks my heart to see what is happening in the rest of the Caribbean, my neighboring islands. You feel helpless when it's a natural disaster. You have no control and these are islands that I have been to and love… it's so sad.”

While attending a show at New York Fashion Week, Heidi Klum told “Extra” on Thursday, "It is horrible what is happening. I hope that everyone will be safe. People are evacuating. I have some friends in Miami, I know that they are leaving right now… it's devastating.”

Earlier this week, Emmy Rossum said at a PaleyFest TV Preview event, “It's upsetting, especially coming on the heels of Harvey. Some of us continue to deny that climate change is a real thing and I think that is very dangerous.”

"Good Morning America" anchor Amy Robach made a trip to Miami International Airport, which was "virtually empty." While many were able to make it out of Miami, thousands of others have been misplaced. She told "Extra" on Friday, "Airport officials have been shuttling people on buses to local shelters to ride out Irma when it makes landfall." Watch.

Kourtney Kardashian is a strict parent when it comes to her kids using technology.

The 38-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashian reality star, who is mom to sons Mason, 7, and Reign, 2, and daughter Penelope, 5,shared her "technology rules" for her kids on her personal app on Tuesday.

Kourtney begins by explaining how "it’s tough to know what's best for our kids when it comes to technology" but says she's found a method that works best for her children.

"Now that all my kids are over the age of two, I do allow them limited time to play video games and watch television," she explains. "We have a game room, so I allow 30 minutes of video game time during the week and an hour on the weekends."

During the week, the kiddos "don't really play with iPads at all," she says, adding, "We used to let them use iPads at restaurants, but rules evolve as kids grow and we learned that didn't always work for us. We want to be able to communicate and have conversations with the kids while eating together—so we try not to have TV or iPads out during breakfast, lunch or dinner."

At night, the family usually cuddles up and watches a movie before their bedtime routine, which includes reading books together."[We] never have iPads during this time (which the kids don't even miss, since they love our reading routine)."

Kourtney also notes that she tries to come up with creative activities for her kids. "Every family is different, but these rules work for us!" she explains.

One of those many creative activities includes having Penelope star in her own YouTube-like tutorials. The eldest Kardashian recently shared two clips of her little girl teaching people how to make slime.

There's something a little bit different about the British royal family nowadays. Sure, 2018 is going to bring us some extra family members: Prince George and Princess Charlotte will be getting a new sibling and we have a wedding to look forward to. But with Meghan Markle in the mix, it feels like we may also be gaining a new People's Princess.

Meghan Markle's influence has jokingly been referred to as the "Markle Sparkle," a phrase that seems particularly fitting considering her glamourous past. But as we edge closer to her May wedding date, it's becoming clear she's having a much bigger impact on the House of Windsor than any of us could have possibly predicted.

Anne also admitted that she and Adam had been trying to decide where to live once they have children as she wants to keep their offspring out of the spotlight.

Jen’s Horror! Aniston is beside herself as ex hubby Justin Theroux could reveal his former A-List lover's deep, dark secrets in a scathing tell-all!

Theroux, 46, is said to be "warning" Aniston, 49, to "fight fair" when it comes to spilling dirt on their nasty split – or "he’ll have no hesitation whipping out the ‘tell-all’ card that would spell utter humiliation."

Although Theroux rep denies the claims, a source tells RadarOnline.com exclusively: “This isn’t Justin’s style but he figures he needs options if Jen fights dirty. If he did go on TV or give an interview that delved into their failed marriage he’d have so much to say about his own frustrations that otherwise won’t be aired."
Chelsea Handler has reportedly ditched her friendship with Jennifer Aniston to forge a relationship with Brad Pitt, proving once and for all that celebrity friendships in Hollywood are little more than smoke and mirrors. Chelsea Handler and Jennifer Aniston were long time BFFs and did everything that best friends would do, including hate each others ex-boyfriends, ex-husbands, and ex-husbands’ new partners.

In fact, Handler has been especially vitriolic towards Angelina Jolie in the past, publicly speaking out against Jolie for ‘stealing’ Brad Pitt away from Jennifer Aniston. Yes, it takes two people to break up a marriage, but Handler always reserved her vitriol for Angelina Jolie, much like the rest of Jennifer Aniston’s close-knit BFF crew (albeit none as vocally as Chelsea Handler).

However, Chelsea and Jennifer have allegedly had a falling out recently, as they’ve barely spent any time together and are clearly (and visibly) on the outs with each other. Some reports claim that this is because Chelsea has been spilling secrets about Jennifer’s marriage to Justin Theroux, and others claim that it was just them naturally growing apart. Regardless, Chelsea’s already gone as far as to find a new BFF in Charlize Theron, and Jennifer? Well, she’s busy with her new husband and working hard to reboot her TV career.

As this has all been happening, a new report from Radar Online claims that Chelsea has been in the process of replacing her friendship with Jennifer Aniston with another relationship – this time with Jennifer’s ex, Brad Pitt! Radar’s source explains, “Chelsea never hated Brad for what he did to Jennifer; she always blamed Angelina Jolie for the nasty split. But now that she isn’t friends with Jen, Chelsea is free to work with Brad. Chelsea has long been a fan of Brad’s Plan B production company and is talking with them about a few projects.”

Plan B is one of the most prolific production companies in town, and has won several Oscars over the past few years. As such, any working actor or actress would jump at the chance to work with them, ex-best friends and ex-grudges aside. It’s likely that Chelsea Handler cozying up to Brad Pitt has little to do with getting back at Jennifer Aniston for cutting off their friendship, and more to do with her own career movement.

What do you guys think? Will Chelsea Handler forget all about her ex-best friend Jennifer Aniston to work with Jennifer’s ex-husband and the man that she spent years dumping on, Brad Pitt? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Ben Affleck is reportedly back on the road to recovery. ET reports that the actor's estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, drove him to rehab. A source said that Affleck knew he needed help and Garner, who has three children with him, was there for him.

Affleck reportedly broke up with his girlfriend of one year, producer Lindsay Shookus. Another source told ET that the actor is focusing on his sobriety and family.

"Ben's priorities remain his family and his sobriety," the source said. "He continues to attend meetings and meditation classes for his well-being. You have to work at your sobriety every day and he does that."

Last year, Affleck said he completed treatment for alcohol addiction and admitted that it was an issue he would "continue to confront." At the time, he said, "I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be. I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step."

He thanked his friends and family, including Garner, for their support and care. He added, "This was the first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery."

ET has reached out to Affleck and Garner's reps for comment.
Drew Barrymore is grateful for her female friendships, especially with her long-time pal, Cameron Diaz.

"We're like more than best friends, she's my sister," the actress and beauty mogul told ET's Lauren Zima at Beautycon Festival LA, where she was celebrating new products from her makeup line, Flower Beauty.

She continued, "We have much more of that kind of relationship, we're very honest with each other. We push each other. And we've had the majority of our lives spent side by side, really going through what real life is, which is an everyday high and low and we just have each other's backs."

The BFFs gave everyone friendship goals when they recently posted a makeup free selfie together, both looking glowy and happy.

Barrymore admitted that sometimes it's easier to go bare.

"I love makeup so much, but it's like we don't have the time or energy to do it all the time, so I'm really into real life," she said about the selfie.

But the 43-year-old added makeup can be a powerful game changer.

"The tiniest little bit of concealer and a lip can make such a difference in your self confidence that it's like, you do it and you think, 'Why would I never not do this?' But I'm a mom, I'm busy and we forget to put a little bit into ourselves. Even one minute, 30 seconds can just sort of boost yourself, and it's important to remember to take that time to do that," Barrymore said.

As for the planned reboot of Charlie's Angels, set to be directed by Elizabeth Banks and rumored to star Kristen Stewart and Lupita Nyong'o, Barrymore was supportive of the idea.

"I'm just excited for them," the Santa Clarita Diet star said. "Because every generation that brings Charlie's Angels out into the world is about the power of three women and what they can do, while loving men and wanting to date them or working side by side with them. But there's just something about Charlie's Angels that make men and women so happy."

"And it's so positive. So if they keep that alive in this new iteration, it's just going to be great," she added.

As far as the wider world is aware, Tom Cruise has not seen his daughter, Suri, for more than five years.

Insiders revealed to Star magazine that the reason Suri is allegedly not allowed to speak to her father publicly is that of his position in the Scientology community as well as concerns from Katie Holmes that her only daughter could become "brainwashed" by the community.

"It's not surprising that Suri is confused by the lack of communication between her parents," the source told the publication.

"She's growing up, asking more questions and it's becoming harder to shield her from the whispers. She wants to speak to her dad."

Tom has never actually given a reason as to why he no longer sees his youngest child.
Brad Pitt

The one that got away. For both, perhaps?

"I f--ked that up, Brad," Paltrow said on the Girlboss Radio podcast when host Sophia Amoruso mentioned Gwyneth's great love of the mid-'to-late-90s, whom she met in 1994 on the set of the thriller Se7en, playing his ill-fated wife.

When he won a Golden Globe for 12 Monkeys in 1996, Pitt's final thank you was reserved for "especially the love o' my life, my angel, Gwyneth Paltrow." They got engaged, they even got matching haircuts, but then they broke up in June 1997.

Paltrow has been relentless in blaming herself for the demise of their relationship, telling Diane Sawyer in 2003, "I'm so lucky that I spent time with Brad, somebody who was such a good person! Especially when I was, like, such a mess." Admittedly the relentless media attention—which peaked when long-lens nude photos of the couple taken while they were vacationing in the Caribbean ended up online—really got to her then, understandably so.

"My kind of internal stuff really tripped up that whole relationship," Paltrow said. "And I felt really responsible, and also like I was the architect of my own misery...I just made a big mess out of it.''

The actress told Howard Stern in 2015 that her beloved father, Bruce Paltrow, who died in 2002, "adored him like a son." But "I was such a kid, I was 22 when we met. It's taken me until 40 to get my head out of my ass. You can't make that decision when you're 22 years old...I wasn't ready, and he was too good for me."

Only recently did Paltrow tell the New York Times that she too was subject to unwanted advances from alleged serial predator Harvey Weinstein roughly 20 years ago, when she was dating Pitt—and that Pitt confronted Weinstein at an event afterward, warning the producer that something like that had best never happen again. So there was more going on at the time for Paltrow to process than anyone publicly knew about for decades.

By the time of the Sawyer sit-down, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston. "We're able to sort of see each other and smile and wish each other well," Paltrow said.
It seems Julia Roberts and Danny Moder may be headed for divorce. When the actress took the part of a worker at a secret government facility on Homecoming, an upcoming political thriller on Amazon, she knew just who she wanted as her co-star: her old pal Dermot Mulroney.

She lobbied for him to join the show, and on March 8, it was officially announced that Dermot, 54 — who starred with Julia in My Best Friend’s Wedding and August: Osage County — would play her character’s boyfriend.

Julia and Dermot.

She was thrilled. Her husband? Furious. “Julia’s reunion with Dermot hasn’t gone down well with Danny,” an insider tells Life & Style. “Even though Julia’s reminded him that Dermot is happily married with children, Danny’s jealous.”

It’s just one of many issues causing problems in Julia and Danny’s marriage. The cameraman and cinematographer “is at the end of his rope,” the insider tells Life & Style. “Julia and Danny are constantly quarreling. Their 15-year marriage is on the rocks, and they could even split.”

Julia and Danny have been drifting apart for years. “Her controlling ways, their different approaches to parenting, and his desire to have his own career, and be the man of the house have all contributed to arguments,” says the insider. But recently, things have gotten worse. “They have been living separate lives,” the insider notes

Julia, Danny, and their three kids in August 2015.

Instead of focusing on repairing his marriage to Julia, 50, Danny, 49, “has been devoting his time to the kids [twins Hazel and Finn, 13, and son Henry, 10], friends, and jobs away from his wife.” When he’s home, the insider says, he often stays across the street from their beachfront compound, in a house they bought in 2016 that was originally meant for guests or nannies. The rift is only continuing to grow. “Julia is a super-protective parent, which has caused friction with Danny, who believes in being more relaxed,” explains the insider.

But when it comes to other men, he’s anything but. When Julia called hunky survivalist Bear Grylls “a man’s man” after they completed a charity trek across Africa together in 2017, “that really got under Danny’s skin,” says the insider. Danny was also seething after his wife turned into what he called a fawning “sports groupie,” the insider says, when they spent time with British and Spanish soccer stars at meet-and-greets in 2016 and 2017.

Danny’s insecurity extends to his career, too: He hates being seen as Mr. Julia Roberts. “For a long time, Danny viewed Julia’s success as his own failure. It triggered a fear that he was not good enough, and the fact that Julia controls everything at home made it worse,” explains the insider. “Feeling insecure and competitive with your partner is no way to live.”

Though they love each other, friends fear they can’t go on like this much longer. “Julia and Danny’s marriage is hanging by a thread,” says the insider. “Unless they can come to terms with their issues, they’re headed for divorce.”

Lopez and Affleck called off their engagement in early 2004, just before their wedding. Weeks later, Lopez reunited with ex Marc Anthony and the two wed after several months and later welcomed twins, Max and Emme, who are now 8. Lopez and Anthony split in 2011. That year, she started dating backup dancer Casper Smart, 28.

Affleck went on to date his Daredevil co-star Jennifer Garner. The two wed in 2005 and had three children, Violet, 10, Seraphina, 7 and Samuel, 4. The couple announced last June they planned to divorce. No papers have been filed.

In 2014, Lopez said on the Today show her and Affleck's split was probably her "first big heartbreak." In 2015, she told HuffPost Live she had "no regrets" about her time with the actor. A month after she spoke to HuffPost Live, Lopez and Affleck reunited briefly at the Oscars.

"I would do it all over again, I think. I really would. Even the relationship part," she told the outlet. "I just feel like everything is part of your story and your journey and is meant to be and helps you grow if you're willing to look at it, and I'm willing to look."

Affleck told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012 he keeps in touch Lopez, as well as other ex-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow and his high school sweetheart, Cheyenne Rothman.

"We don't have the kind of relationship where she relies on me for advice," he said about Lopez, "but we do have the kind of relationship where there'll be an e-mail saying, 'Oh, your movie looks great.' I remember when she got American Idol. I said, 'This was really smart. Good luck.'"

"I touch base," he said. "I respect her. I like her. She's put up with some stuff that was unfair in her life, and I'm really pleased to see her successful."


They can no longer even pretend to make it work. For years, it’s been rumored that Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have had troubles in their marriage — but an insider tells In Touch exclusively that the pair, who have been married since 2008, are officially at their breaking point, and divorce is officially inevitable.

“They’re not going to make it. Their roller-coaster marriage is about to derail,” the insider tells the magazine.

The reason they have held off until this point isn’t a coincidence: Next August marks 10 years since they tied the knot, and after making it a decade together, California law could mean Portia is entitled to more of Ellen’s money (Ellen is worth an estimated $360 million, compared to Portia’s $20 million fortune). Should Ellen want to protect herself (and her estate), she would need to end their union before the big anniversary come August. But it’s unlikely that that’ll happen — as Ellen was the one hoping to make things work. The insider adds, “[Ellen’s] friends know she would do whatever it takes to stay married to Portia, and she has. They’ve gone to individual and couples counseling.”

Of course, it isn’t surprising that Ellen, 59, isn’t as keen to divorce as her wife, 44; according to the insider, her controllng ways played a huge role in their crumbling relationship. “Ellen is a control freak, and she prety much micromanages Portia’s personal and professional life,” the insider explains, adding that Portia is far from innocent. “Ellen is tired of being told to change this and change that about herself. It’s a sad situation. Ellen doesn’t want to get a divorce. She’s a romantic.”

With the potential trouble looming around the “10-year rule,” as it’s known informally in California, the legal battle looming ahead is likely to be an ugly one. And the personal battle will be just as ugly for their loved ones and fans. The insider laments, “No one wants to see them split up.”
