Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs first announced that they are officially dating in 2014. However, recent reports are claiming that former boyfriend of Kristen Stewart is hooking up with American singer Katy Perry.

Is the ‘Twilight’ actor cheating on his fiancée?

Gossip Cop was quick to debunk the claims saying that Robert Pattinson is hooking up with Katy Perry. The publication claimed that the former boyfriend of Kristen Stewart is not seeing the “Roar” singer behind the back of FKA Twigs.

TMZ previously claimed that Pattinson and Perry were spotted getting flirty with each other at the Sunset Tower Hotel.

According to the news outlet, the former partners of Kristen Stewart and Orlando Bloom were eating with a number of friends but they later separated with the crowd later that night.

Speculations have it that Robert Pattinson and Katy Perry started secretly seeing each other following the latter’s split with the “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor. This, according to TMZ, is amid the reports that the “New Moon” star is affianced to FKA Twigs.

While these romance rumors could possibly be true, Gossip Cop claimed that these reports are completely made up. As a matter of fact, Pattinson has reiterated on the “Howard Stern Show” that he is tying the knot with Twigs soon.

Moreover, Us Weekly shared Katy Perry has also divulged that she and Robert Pattinson are just friends.

The “Thinking of You” songstress added that she treats FKA Twigs’ fiancé as a brother.

Perry even said that she never slept with Pattinson. The former BFF of Taylor Swift also emphasized that there is no bad blood between her and Kristen Stewart.

Is the ‘Teenage Dream’ singer using Kristen Stewart’s ex-bf?

Meanwhile, Celeb Dirty Laundry has claimed Katy Perry could possibly be using Robert Pattinson to break into acting.

The rumor website claimed that this could be the American songstress’ strategy to gain a position into an acting career.

“When you consider that acting street cred as being one of the things that Katy Perry is so desperately seeking, it’s not difficult to put two and two together,” CDL claimed. The publication even added that this is not the very first time that Pattinson is being used by someone for fame since Twigs allegedly had the same scheme.

Robert Pattinson, FKA Twigs and Katy Perry have yet to comment on these allegations. Hence, fans should take these speculations with a grain of salt until everything is proven true and correct. After all, Celeb Dirty Laundry is known to be a spreader of baseless rumors. Stay tuned for more news and updates!

Ashley Tisdale is shooting down silly rumors that she’s expecting a baby with hubby Christopher French.

The High School Musical alum took to Twitter to clear things up after people started speculating that she was pregnant.

PHOTOS: Check out the latest pics of Ashley Tisdale

“The pressure to being perfect is a struggle.No im not pregnant,I’m just happy and haven’t been strict on my diet but thanks for the reminder,” Ashley tweeted.

Ashley looked stunning in blue at the 2017 Elton John AIDS Foundation’s Academy Awards Viewing Party on Sunday (February 26) in West Hollywood, Calif.
The death of legendary Allman Brothers co-founder Gregg Allman sent the music industry into despair, with many stars sharing their sympathies on Twitter.

The southern-blues rocker died at his home in Savannah, Georgia on Saturday, at the age of 69. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1999 and underwent a liver transplant in 2010, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Musicians like John Mayer, Peter Frampton and Keith Urban shared memories and photos of Allman after hearing the news. “He showed me his tattoos… his voice…. his soul. #GreggAllman,” tweeted Melissa Etheridge under a photo of herself with Allman.

Allman’s ex-wife Cher struggled to find words to express her sadness: “IVE TRIED…WORDS ARE IMPOSSIBLE GUI GUI💔 FOREVER, CHOOCH💋,” she wrote.

A mix of love and shock from celebrities continues to pour in over social media:

Health battles had forced Allman to cancel upcoming June concert dates, but the guitarist denied rumors that he was currently in hospice care. In April, the guitarist posted a message on social media in which he clarified his current health status.

“Hey everyone. I just wanted y’all to know that I’m currently home in Savannah resting on my doctor’s orders,” he wrote. “I want to thank you for all the love that you are sending. Looking forward to seeing everyone again. Keep Rockin.”

Allman fronted his band for 45 years, first alongside Duane and then as its sole namesake, after his older brother — a rock history luminary — was killed in a motorcycle accident in November 1971.

Rita’s sexy Fifty Shades Freed duet with the 1D star, For You, is on course to become the biggest new entry on the official charts this week.

But producers of the upcoming movie sequel had different plans for the first single and wanted Justin Bieber to be the man to get listeners hot under the collar.

A source told me: “Originally Universal Pictures wanted Justin Bieber to sing a song on the soundtrack, either with or without Rita.

“He’s the biggest male pop star in the world and so that’s what they aimed for.

(Image: GETTY)

“They had the world’s biggest female pop star in Taylor Swift do the last film, so they were keen for something a bit different because Zayn Malik sang that with her and he comes from One Direction as well.”

However, after a turbulent 14-month concert tour Justin is intent on having a break and made it clear he would not be taking on any extra recording commitments.

Fortunately Liam was on hand and got involved thanks to Rita, who had the tune prepped with songwriter pals Ali Payami, Ali Tamposi and Andrew Watt.

And he couldn’t be happier to have another hit under his belt.

He gushed: “Me and Rita are absolutely overjoyed with the reaction so far to For You. We are super happy.”

Reets celebrated the early success with a Fifty Shades inspired snap.
Like Blake Lively’s recently purged Instagram photos, the actress’ latest character has gone missing in the new trailer for Bridesmaids helmer Paul Feig’s upcoming mystery A Simple Favor.

“I do consider Emily my best friend. She’s this wonderful, elegant person,” Anna Kendrick (as Stephanie) says of Lively’s character in the preview, which the latter debuted Wednesday morning via her Twitter account. Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding, who plays Emily’s husband, Sean, continues: “She is an enigma, my wife. You can get close to her, but never quite reach her.”

As quick flashes of police sirens, a violent car crash, and deliciously smirky glances flash onscreen, Emily reminds us: “Everybody has a dark side. Some of us are better at hiding it than others.”

The biggest reveal the trailer presents, however, is Emily grinning in a crimson wig after Stephanie explains: “Five days ago, Emily went missing. I’m realizing I don’t know her as well as I thought I did. Emily, if you’re out there, we’re all really worried!”

In anticipation of the trailer’s release, Lively sent fans into a tizzy Monday by deleting all of her Instagram posts save for a single photo of a hangman-style game which spelled out the question, “What happened to Emily?” As of Wednesday, Lively unfollowed most of the accounts she previously tracked, and is now following only women named Emily Nelson — 37 of them, to be exact.

A Simple Favor — also starring Rupert Friend, Jean Smart, Linda Cardellini, Andrew Rannells, and Sarah Baker — is set for release on Sept. 14. Watch the film’s trailer above.
Authorities responded to Scott Disick‘s home in August for a possible 5150 psychiatric hold, according to multiple reports.

A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Fire Department confirmed to PEOPLE that on Aug. 18, they were dispatched to a home in Hidden Hills, California, at 4:56 p.m. They arrived on the scene at 5:03 p.m.

Lost Hills Sheriffs also responded to assist, and one patient was transported to a local hospital.

According to E! News, the call was made from Disick’s home, though the identity of the patient remains unclear.

Entertainment Tonight reported the same, adding that the Los Angeles County Fire Department confirmed that the patient, who was male, was non-violent when authorities arrived at the residence before being transported to the hospital.

A 5150 hold is an involuntary psychiatric hold that occurs when a person is deemed to be a danger to either themselves or others. The patient can be held in a psychiatric hospital for up to 72 hours, unless it is extended. According to The Blast, Disick was released prior to that.

“Scott is definitely trying to get better, but he still has bad moments,” a source tells PEOPLE. “When he starts partying, he doesn’t know when to stop. It’s concerning to see. Everyone hopes he’ll continue on a good path.”

Since Aug. 18, Disick has been spotted in public several times, most recently in New York City for Fashion Week, dining with Kim Kardashian at Milo’s restaurant Wednesday night.

Earlier this week, a source told PEOPLE that the 34-year-old is working on bettering himself after a summer of partying hard. The insider said Disick is now monitoring his drinking and has “been feeling better.”

“He’s been really good. He was just in Vegas and didn’t drink,” the source said. “When he felt like he was about to slip, he would call friends who talked him off the edge.”

“He was definitely spiraling for a while,” the source added. “But he got fed up with himself and was over his own stupid behavior.”

Disick’s antics throughout the months of May and June put serious strain on his relationship with ex Kourtney Kardashian, but the pair reunited with their three children — sons Mason, 7, and Reign, 2, and daughter Penelope, 5 — in mid-July for a low-key family getaway to Nantucket.

According to the source, his relationship with Kourtney, 38, has been improving.

“He was just tired,” the source said, adding that Disick working on himself has “been good for his relationship with Kourtney.”
The convict, who served nine years for armed robbery and assault, was close friends with her dad, Robert Kardashian, but is rumoured to have had a secret fling with his wife Kris Jenner during their marriage, something she has always denied.

But according to America’s Star magazine, that didn’t stop The Juice from calling the reality star the minute he walked free from Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada, and pals claim they had a positive conversation.

“He was on the phone with Khloe the day he got out of jail,” an insider revealed. “He told Khloe that he wasn’t calling to harass her, just to touch base because she and her brother Rob have been on his mind for years.”

O.J allegedly told her the call was one of his main priorities, and although she was stunned, she “heard him out and was polite”, while he suggested meeting face-to-face to discuss a DNA test.

Despite deciding against having one in the past, there has been talk Khloe, and her brother Rob, are considering finally finding out the truth - after rumors her sibling could also be O.J’s biological son.
Is Heather Locklear Joining RHOBH?!

The actress might be getting her own diamond!

Genny Glassman

In a turn of events that would truly be shocking, is it possible that actress Heather Locklear will be joining the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills? We’re not so sure that this story checks out.

The buzz started yesterday, April 9, when Lisa Rinna was a guest on Andy Cohen’s radio show, Radio Andy. The two talked Housewives, Amelia’s history with mental health, and Andy even probed Lisa about her relationship her former Melrose Place co-star.

“Did you have a friendship with [Heather Locklear]?” the Bravo host asked.

“I did and I will say to you, I learned more from Heather […] I learned professionalism, coming in and owning a set, and being kind to everyone, and polite, and on time, knew their lines, funny,” Rinna tells him. “Heather Locklear was everything and she was one of the biggest starts of that time.”

But things have not been smooth sailing for Locklear as of late. “It’s sad whatever demons she’s dealing with,” Andy says.

Of course Andy is referring to Locklear’s brush with the law that happened earlier this year. In February, People reported that the ’90s icon was arrested on suspicion of domestic battery against her then-boyfriend, Chris Heisser, and three counts of battery on a police officer.

Reportedly, Locklear started the altercation when she threw a Red Bull can at Heisser because she felt that he had “lied to her.” She told police officers that Heisser had then tried to strangle her in retaliation, and while these validity of these claims proved to be inconclusive, (Heisser denies these claims, saying “I never touched her”), police did find blood on the bridge of Heisser’s nose and red marks across his chest. He told them that Locklear had attacked him, “bit his face,” and struck him from anywhere “between 20 – 30 minutes.” When police arrived, things got ugly quickly and the night ended with Locklear in a pair of handcuffs yelling at police, “You f***ing deserve your kids to die! You f***ing deserve it!” Yikes.

So is Heather strong enough to duke it out with the ladies of the RHOBH? “You know it was my fantasy — wouldn’t it have been great to get Heather on the Beverly Hills Housewives?” Andy tells Rinna.

“Maybe we still can,” Lisa Rinna answers.

“Start checking it with her,” Andy pleads.

Naturally anyone who brings the drama is prime housewives material in our book, but in the case of Heather Locklear we think that this is one rumor that should stay a fantasy.

Let us know, do you think Heather Locklear should be on reality TV?
Rumors have been swirling that Christina El Moussa could be headed to the “Real Housewives” franchise, but a source with knowledge of the situation told Fox News the “Flip or Flop” star hasn’t been in touch with Bravo execs.

OK Magazine reported earlier this month that Bravo was hoping to get El Moussa on “The Real Housewives of Orange County.” But so far, nothing is in the works, Fox News has learned.

“Christina is currently focused on filming new episodes of ‘Flip or Flop’ and has not been approached by Bravo executives,” a source told us.

El Moussa stars with her now ex Tarek on HGTV’s hit “Flip or Flop.” On the series, the two take dated, often crumbling homes and flip them in the hopes of turning a serious profit. Each episode chronicles the pair’s search for a property, construction and design work.

Christina has recently been sharing snapshots from the set of “Flip or Flop.”


Fans have always longed for ’90s golden couple Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston to get back together — something Justin Theroux became keenly aware of two years ago when he found love notes Aniston had saved from the heartthrob, a source recalls in the new issue of Us Weekly.

The duo, who started dating in May 2011, tied the knot in August 2015. While it was Theroux’s first marriage, Aniston was married to Pitt, 54, from 2000 to 2005. He infamously moved on from the Friends alum with his Mr. and Mrs. Smith costar, Angelina Jolie.

After months of speculation, Kim Kardashian West's youngest sister has released a 10 minute video detailing the pregnancy and the safe arrival of her healthy daughter.

Kylie and Travis split?

It was reported Kylie and Travis split in the last few months of her pregnancy but the baby clip - put together by close friends - tells a different story.

Showing Kylie and Travis completely loved up, and in the delivery room as she gave birth only days ago, the duo couldn't be happier.

Kylie Jenner's 'baby bump'

With her absence from social media, fans were on the look out for a baby bump and have even found an old social media video from the Golden Globes where they're convinced they can spot a baby bump.

Photos taken "months ago" from her friend's birthday party, also show Kylie in an oversized jumper, concealing her figure.

Kardashian Christmas card

After 24 days of snippets from the famous Kardashian Christmas card, fans were convinced day 25, Christmas Day, would be the big reveal.

However, Kylie was nowhere to be seen at all, leaving fans sure that Travis Scott's girlfriend was heavily pregnant.

Fans were still convinced a baby announcement was on the way after spotting a 'clue' in one of the Kardashian Christmas calendar photos.

Kris and Kourtney are among some of the family members looking off-camera, beaming happily at something - or someone.

One fan commented on Twitter: "Half of the Christmas card are looking at something THEY’RE LOOKING AT KYLIE JENNER HOLDING THAT BABY IM TELLING U."

Kylie Jenner to pick a unique baby name

Fans thought she may have gone with the name Butterfly given she and Travis both have matching small butterfly tattoos on their ankles.

Kylie to QUIT social media

In December 2015 Kylie Jenner told Elle UK she would delete her account as soon as she has a child.

"Once I have a kid I’m not going to be on Instagram," Kylie told the magazine. “You know, I’ll probably delete my Instagram and just… I don’t know, live life.”

Kylie demands more privacy

According to People magazine, the reason Kylie is being so shy about the reports is because she wants more privacy.

A source told them: "Kylie prefers to stay home. She feels good, but her body is changing. She doesn’t want to be photographed.

"At the moment, she wants more privacy. She has family and friends come to her house instead so she has company."

Just a month after the loss of her mom Carrie Fisher and grandma Debbie Reynolds, Billie wants to tie the knot with her boyfriend.

Jan 31, 2017

AceShowbiz - Billie Lourd is coping very well following the loss of her mom Carrie Fisher and grandma Debbie Reynolds. It's all thanks to her boyfriend Taylor Lautner who is doing his best to help Billie enjoy herself with a trip to Cabo San Lucas.

Rumor has it, Billie wants to tie the knot with Taylor, just a month after the loss of her loved ones. However, some think the 24-year-old actress is getting too close to the "Twilight" actor too quickly and she needs time to breathe.

"Carrie and Debbie were everything to Billie. Now she has this huge hole in her life and we are worried that she will rush into marriage with Taylor to fill it," a friend tells Naughty Gossip, "He is a great guy, but she needs to take a little time before she rushes into any life changing decision. The family wishes that she takes her time and makes no major decisions while she is still grieving."

Earlier this month, Billie and Taylor were photographed holding hands while they enjoyed some quiet pool time together in Cabo San Lucas. They entered to take a dip and smiled while looking at their phones together.

She’s reeling in the award for mother of the year.

Lindsay Lohan — who appeared to be smoking a cigarette after revealing to her father that she was pregnant last week — was photographed holding a beer while fishing on a boat in Italy Thursday.

The “Mean Girls” star sported a striped, one-piece swimsuit and appeared to have a bulge that led to baby bump speculation while soaking up the sun in Sardinia, Italy with a gal pal.

Lindsay Lohan seems to be downing a beer in Italy.

The 30-year-old actress, who is still wearing her engagement ring following a bombshell argument with her fiancé, texted her father Michael Lohan last week, “Daddy, I’m pregnant,” he confirmed to the Daily News Wednesday.

“I certainly believe it. There’s no reason she would lie about that — something that serious,” Michael said.

“Lindsay is very maternal. She loves kids, and I’m sure she’s wanted a baby for a long time. And what better time than when she’s sober and healthy,” he added.

Lindsay posted and deleted photos from her 2009 movie “Labor Pains” earlier this week with the caption, “Lindsay lohan labour pains trailer — I am pregnant!!”

Lindsay Lohan (r.) sported a striped, one-piece swimsuit and appeared to have a bulge that led to baby bump speculation while soaking up the sun in Sardinia, Italy.

The pregnancy speculation is just one bit of the recent drama plaguing the actress.

Lindsay was seen having an explosive argument with her fiancé, Egor Tarabasov last weekend in a video obtained by The Sun, accusing him of infidelity and of trying to kill her.

Authorities later deemed both her and Tarabasov, “safe and well.”

Since the fight, Lindsay took off for Italy and appears to be living carefree while her Russian billionaire beau was spotted moving all of his belongings out of her apartment.
Rihanna got herself a hunky boyfriend but her ex-lover, Drake, doesn't think she deserves the dude. After the Barbadian singer heated up the internet with her photos with Hassan Jameel, the Canadian rapper reportedly reacted and said that he is wondering why his former girlfriend fell for the Arabian business tycoon.

Drake is reportedly starting to regret letting go of RiRi

A source told Hollywood Life that the "Thank Me Later" artist was "kinda jealous" when he found out that his ex-girlfriend is already seeing a new guy. “Drake is kinda jealous of Rihanna’s new billionaire boyfriend.

He has no idea why she likes this guy,” it said.

It added that despite their on-off relationship, the 30-year-old rapper is still affected whenever the "What's My Name" singer is caught up in dating rumors. “Drake thinks Rihanna is one of the baddest chicks’s ever and he doesn’t think this new guy deserves her at all,” the insider added.

Aside from him, rumor has it that Naomi Campbell, who previously dated Hassan, was "furious" when she saw her ex-boyfriend getting cozy with her former bestie. The English model reportedly said that she is still "hotter and more successful" than RiRi and guaranteed that her relationship with him won't last long.

This rumor has caused the fans to speculate about Campbell and Rihanna's stained friendship which was first noticed by an eagle-eyed fan who figured out that the two have stopped following each other on social media earlier this year.

When asked if she has a beef with her best friend, the 47-year-old model suggested that she is just pretending that everything is fine between them.

Rihanna and Hassan's Ibiza getaway

RiRi and Hassan, both 29, were first seen in public during their romantic vacation in Spain on Wednesday. Several photos of them getting all steamy in the swimming pool immediately went viral and had caused the public to start digging about the new guy.

It was later revealed that he is the expected heir of a $1.5 billion business called Abdul Latif Jameel which has acquired the distribution rights to Toyota in Saudi Arabia.

Their family business has placed them in 12th spot on the list of richest Arabs in the world by Forbes. Hassan currently works as the Deputy President and Vice Chairman of the said company.

Aside from that, his family also owns Saudi Professional League or Jameel League which was founded in 1976.

After spending some down time at their luxury villa, Rihanna and her billionaire beau stepped out in public on the same day, where the singer was seen holding a bouquet of flowers while her the tycoon was all smiles walking behind his girl.
Jamie Foxx, 49, and Katie Holmes, 38, are allegedly having a baby! Katie has reportedly dropping hints to friends that she’s pregnant, according to an insider who spoke to OK! Magazine. She and Jamie haven’t officially announced the alleged pregnancy, but all signs point to a little bundle of joy. The happy news comes shortly after the couple went public with their relationship after reportedly dating for two years. How exciting!

“[Katie’s] adjusted her workout and is avoiding alcohol,” the insider told OK! Magazine. “They’ve also started talking with friends about their future as a family. They aren’t confirming a pregnancy yet, but they’re not denying it either. They’re thrilled [their relationship is] finally out in the open. Neither of them wanted to sneak around anymore.”

That’s amazing! Katie, of course, has a child with ex-husband Tom Cruise — 11-year-old Suri Cruise. Jamie is the father of two beautiful daughters from prior relationships: Corinne, 23, and Annalise, 8. Giving the girls a half-sibling would make this one, big, happy family. It’s unclear when Jamie and Katie would announce their alleged pregnancy, but eagle-eyed paps seem to think it’ll be soon. The couple were spotted walking on the beach in Los Angeles, and Katie was wearing an uncharacteristically large, flowy dress. Could she be hiding a baby bump? Maybe! Or, maybe she just wants to be comfortable for a casual outing! Let the woman live!https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/09/11/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-happy-dating-tom-cruise-relationship/

Baby or not, Katie and Jamie are having the time of their lives right now. As a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY, Katie feels happier now with Jamie than she ever did when she was married to Tom. Katie “adores his sense of humor,” and can see him becoming a wonderful father figure to Suri — who reportedly hasn’t seen her own father in four years. A separate source close to Katie told us EXCLUSIVELY that Katie’s happy with the way things are and not in a rush to get married. They didn’t say anything about a baby, though!

HollywoodLife.com has reached out to both Katie and Jamie’s reps for comment.

It was a perfect summer date night for Ben Affleck.

At Malibu’s upscale Nobu restaurant August 16, the Justice League actor was rapt in conversation with his table mate: a bombshell blonde clad in a nude bodycon dress. Three days later, the lovebirds emerged once again at Santa Monica’s decidedly more-low key Jack in the Box drive-thru. With fries and a cheeseburger in hand, the all-smiles duo sped off in his Range Rover. According to a witness, “They looked so happy together.”

Something was off, however. The passenger was not his love of more than a year, Lindsay Shookus — but 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton. Not only had Affleck, 46, and the Saturday Night Live producer, 38, quietly split — “it’s amicable,” says a source — in just two weeks, the actor had also reverted back to his womanizing ways. It’s a behavior his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, knows all too well. While still with Garner, Affleck began secretly dating Shookus. And just weeks after the parents of Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, announced the end of their decade-long marriage, Affleck moved on with their then 28-year-old nanny, Christine Ouzounian.

“Jen realized a long time ago that she cannot fix Ben and that his problems are not hers to solve,” a Garner confidant reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. “She’s not his babysitter. She just wants to protect the kids. But she does wish Ben would keep his life more private.”

Rarely one to be alone, Affleck was quick to find comfort in the arms of Sexton post split. (After photos of them hit the internet, Shookus deleted her Instagram account.) Evenings out aside, Affleck and Playboy’s Miss May 2018 have clocked plenty of hours holed up in his $20 million, seven-bedroom Pacific Palisades bachelor pad, says an insider — much to the dismay of Garner.

“Of course she’s not pleased he’s dating a 22-year-old Playboy model,” says the Garner confidant. “But she’s also not surprised. Jen has come to expect this from Ben. She’s not going to get involved. She can’t make decisions for him.”

Blac Chyna just got nailed by the judge in the lawsuit she's filed against Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner ... the judge has tentatively agreed to dismiss them entirely from her lawsuit claiming the Kardashians torpedoed her reality show.

Chyna's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, squared off in court Thursday with Kardashian lawyer Shawn Holley. Holley was gunning for the judge to get her clients dismissed from the case, and the judge saw her point.

The best part ... the judge reacted to Chyna's claim that E! dropped "Rob & Chyna" because the Kardashians painted her as a bad mother. The judge confessed he didn't watch the show, but said it's hard to imagine E! wouldn't do a show where the woman is a bad mother!

The judge scoffed at Chyna's claim that the Kardashians interfered with her E! contract, saying Chyna was only in negotiations with the network and didn't have an enforceable contract.

In the end, the judge bought the argument that Kim and Kris did not interfere with Chyna's contract with E!, but did give Chyna the right to a second bite of the apple where she could try and create a new case against the 2 women.


We miss the old Kanye… Ahead of the release of his new album, Kanye West has been tweeting non-stop and proclaiming his love for Donald Trump. Now, it is being revealed he has a big request for the President — and it involves his youngest daughter Chicago.

“Kanye’s infatuated with Trump and is considering asking POTUS to be Chicago’s godfather,” a source told In Touch exclusively. “He loves, respects, and admires Trump and feels a man of his prestige and power would be a perfect influence in children’s lives.”

However, his wife Kim Kardashian is completely opposed to the idea. “She despises Trump and doesn’t like what he stands for and is telling Kanye that he needs to choose somebody else. Kanye’s adamant that he wants to ask Trump and it’s resulted in them having a huge blowout argument,” the source added. “Trump is a huge no no for Kim but Kanye’s really a huge fan and supporter of his and that’s a bone of contention in their marriage.”

In case you were wondering, North and Saint West‘s godmothers are Khloé and Kourtney Kardashian, respectively. However, their godfathers have never been revealed.

Earlier this week, it was reported that friends were worried the “Faded” rapper are worried about his current mental health after he spoke with radio host Ebro and allegedly said he loved Trump — along with claim he had an opioid addiction. On Twitter, Kanye has denied the allegations.

“There’s been a lot of fake news so I just wanted to give you the facts,” he wrote. “Yeezy will become the biggest apparel company in human history by working with the most genius level talents and creating product at an affordable price. I hired the head of supply chain from the Gap.” He also called himself this generation’s “Ford Hughes Jobs Disney.”

Let’s hope Kim wins this godfather battle.
According to America’s Star magazine, the model and ‘Keeping Up With The Kardashians’ TV star, 21, sought “a subtle sharpening of the tip” in a bid to straighten out what she believed to be a supposedly inferior snout.

An insider told the publication, “People think modeling is a constant stream of compliments for her, but most of the time it’s brutal.

“On castings the clients analyze her from head to toe and point out all her flaws.

“Eventually Kendall got tired of people saying her nose wasn’t slim enough so she went and tried to fix it, again.”

The snitch claimed Kendall was “thrilled with the results,” and that the surgery was inspired by her alleged “idol”, fellow supermodel Christy Turlington.
Twilight fans never thought they'd see Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart back together again, but this is 2018 and anything's possible.

A source tells E! News the exes reunited at a birthday party for Lily-Rose Depp at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles over the weekend. In photos published by The Daily Mail, R. Patz and K. Stew are seen mingling outside. An eyewitness says the former co-stars—whose relationship was cut short by a cheating scandal in 2012—spent a "few minutes" chatting in the valet area and appeared "friendly" and on "good terms."

"Kristen smoked a cigarette and Rob stood and talked to her quietly," the insider describes. "They were both serious, but stood together alone behind a car and exchanged a few words."
Ariana Grande would have one less problem if all of the pesky rumors about her alleged outrageous diva behavior would go away.

Gossip about the young songstress’s ‘tude have been running rampant this year. Some of the stories might have a nugget of truth hidden in them, but most are just so out there that they couldn’t possible have any merit, right?

The most recent rumor says that Grande forces her staff to carry her like a baby, according to In Touch magazine. “Her new rule is that she has to be carried — literally like a baby — when she doesn’t feel like walking,” a source told the magazine. “She says she doesn’t want her precious feet to hit the floor.”

Here are some other outlandish rumors about Grande that have popped up.

1. She refused to do the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge

According to Star magazine, Grande would not film herself having ice dumped over her head because she refuses to be seen without her hair extensions or full makeup. “Celebrities all over the world are doing it for a good cause, but she doesn’t care,” Star says a source told them. “Her skin is a big problem for her and she absolutely does not want to be seen barefaced.”

2. She threatens lighting crews with drastic measures if they mess up

In August, Grande allegedly berated a lighting crew and made sure she was only shot from certain angles. “She was a total nightmare,” a source told Star. “She demanded to be shot only on her left side and told the lighting crew that if they used red light, she would ‘kill herself.'”

3. She has an assistant feed her water with a straw

“She had an assistant follow her around with a bottle of water and a straw,” a witness told Star. “And as soon as she was feeling a bit parched, she would scream ‘Water!’ and the girl would scurry over… At one point, the water was too warm for her liking, so she spit it out!”

4. She elbowed Giuliana Rancic in the side

Grande allegedly strong-armed Rancic into moving out of her way during an interview, again to make sure she was only seen from her good side. It seems that this rumor might actually be true, because the allegations come straight from Rancic’s mouth. “I remember, I think I was at the AMAs, she came up on the platform and normally I stand on this side to the camera,” Rancic said, according to Perez Hilton. “Little Ariana comes over like all bink [mimics an elbow jab] with an elbow in my side. I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’ And they pushed me to the other side.”

5. She wished death upon her fans

According to a source, Grande was all smiles while signing autographs for fans earlier this year, but said some pretty brutal things as soon as they were out of earshot. “As soon as the doors [of an elevator] shut she said, ‘I hope they all f***ing die,'” an insider told the New York Daily News.

6. She ordered her security to delete a fan’s camera photos

A couple of very disappointed fans took to Twitter after meeting Grande, who was alleged very distant and snubbed them at a meet and greet.

What do you think? Is there truth to any these rumors, or are they just crazy talk?
What does music’s most prominent power couple gift fashion’s most prominent power couple when a new baby arrives? Well, if you’re Beyonce, 36, and JAY-Z, 48, it’s a custom-made, diamond Lorraine Schwartz bracelet, worth a whooping $21,000, according to The Sun. That’s right, Kim Kardashian, 37, and Kanye West‘s third baby — who arrived on January 15 — is about to be the most decked out infant, well… ever. And, get this — Bey and JAY reportedly had the bracelet engraved with the number “3,” to signify Kimye’s third offspring.

“Beyonce and Jay could not be more pleased for them, they can’t wait to meet the little one, and have sent them this gift already,” a source told the outlet. “It shows they have all moved on from the past, and they are ‘familia’ once more.” Although all parties involved are reportedly thrilled about burying the hatchet, “Kanye is over the moon as he has always considered JAY Z his ‘big brother,’ and Beyonce has always been one of his closest friends.” Ironically, both power couples have three children each, and “it’s only a matter of time before the playdates begin,” the source added. Bey and JAY are parents to twins Sir and Rumi, who they welcomed in June 2016, and Blue Ivy, 6. Kim and Kanye are parents their daughter, North, 4, and son, Saint, 1, along with their new baby girl.

While this report indicates that JAY-Z and Kanye’s feud is over, JAY already hinted that he wanted to bury the hatchet during an interview with The New York Times back in November 2017. “But, that happens,” JAY admitted about there being tension with Ye’. JAY explained: “In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we’re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I’m saying? There’s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, ‘These are the things that I’m uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.’ I’m sure he feels that I’ve done things to him as well. You know what I’m saying? These are — I’m not a perfect human being by no stretch. You know.” JAY also said that he had recently spoken with Ye’ [at the time] and that they would always be good with each other. “I love Kanye. I do,” he said, adding, “It’s a complicated relationship with us.”

As you may know, JAY and Ye’s friendship took a hit back in 2016. In October of that year, Kanye went on a rant during one of his concerts where he slammed both JAY and Beyonce. He claimed their kids didn’t play together, and he revealed that there was tension between him and JAY because of a TIDAL music dispute. Ye’ even said that JAY and Beyonce didn’t even call after Kim’s 2016 Paris robbery. Just days after his rant, Kanye checked into UCLA Medical Center for an 8-9-day stay for an alleged mental breakdown.

HollywoodLifers, do you think Bey, JAY, Kim and Ye are all friends again?
ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.

A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.

Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.

The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.

“Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.

“GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.

The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.

Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.
How can you be bored at the Video Music Awards?! Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott were guests at MTV’s epic awards show on Aug. 20, but some fans thought they didn’t look like they were enjoying themselves enough… especially during Jennifer Lopez’s epic medley performance!

JLo was honored with the annual Video Vanguard award, but before she accepted it she performed a medley of basically every song you can think of. “Get Right,” “Jenny From The Block,” “Get On The Floor,” “Ain’t Yo Momma,” “Love Don’t Cost A Thing,” seriously, all the faves. To make it more epic, she brought out Ja Rule, DJ Khaled, and more stars to perform with her.

And yet, when the cameras cut to the audience, they caught Kylie and Travis just sitting there, staring off into space without so much as a smile. Meanwhile, everyone around them was up out of their chairs dancing the night away, as you do. Suffice it to say, fans were offended by the #disrespect.

Kylie can show some damn respect to JLo #VMAs — Alex Murillo (@Alextacy21) August 21, 2018

Kylie get your sorry ass up to pay respects to the queen JLO #VMAs — FRC (@fannyyrc) August 21, 2018

Maybe Kylie and Travis didn’t enjoy themselves as much as they should have, but plenty of other fans were beyond thrilled about the performance. “JLo, watching your performance and then your speech made me even prouder than I already was,” said one heartfelt tweet. “Keep rocking like you’ve always done, you will forever be my inspiration and I love you.”
Who do you think is in the right?

The Queen is reportedly 'livid' with Prince William and his wife the Duchess of Cambridge.

According to Life & Style magazine, a dispute has sprung up over a conversation about Kate's royal duties. Prince William had called the Queen to suggest that his wife - who is pregnant with their third child - scale back her royal duties permanently.

'Kate wants her public appearances kept to a minimum and he's 100% behind her' the source told the publication, adding that 'the conversation was quite icy.'

Kate is reportedly more comfortable in her role as a full time mother to George (4) and Charlotte (2) than as a working royal. The Duchess of Cambridge is currently patron to a number of charities, including The Art Room, National Portrait Gallery, East Anglia's Children's Hospice and Action on Addiction.

But according to Life & Style, 'the 91-year-old monarch was livid that the future Queen would want to lessen her duties.'

The Queen's own experiences as a mother and working royal could be the reason she disapproves of Kate and Will's decision. She was 25 with two small children (Charles and Anne) when her father died and she ascended to the throne, and went on to have two more children (Andrew and Edward) after she was crowned, regularly leaving them at home with nursery staff while she went on official tours of the Commonwealth.

In his 1994 authorised biography, Prince Charles is said to have found his parents 'emotionally reserved.' It was the nursery staff who 'taught him to play, witnessed his first steps, punished and rewarded him, helped him put his first thoughts into words' the biography claimed.

This is not the first parenting style clash between the Queen and younger generations of the royal family. She reportedly disagreed with William's mother Diana's decision to take him on tour to Australia and New Zealand when he was nine months old. Diana was said to have found the idea of being apart from William too difficult.

In a clip from her 90th birthday celebrations last year the Queen was also seen telling William to 'get up' when the family appeared on the balcony to wave at crowds - he was crouching down to show George the planes doing a fly over.

William and Kate have already adopted a more modern attitude to parenting than their parents and grandparents, sending George to a local Montessori nursery in Norfolk and then onto Thomas's in Battersea, where he recently had his first day of school.
Casey Affleck talked about the #MeToo movement in the actor’s first interview since resurfaced sexual harassment allegations forced him to avoid participating in this year’s Oscars.

Speaking to the Associated Press, Affleck discussed his decision to break tradition and skip this year’s Academy Awards, where – as winner of Best Actor for Manchester by the Sea the previous year – he was scheduled to present Best Actress; past winners Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence instead presented the award.

“I think it was the right thing to do just given everything that was going on in our culture at the moment,” Affleck said. “And having two incredible women go present the best actress award felt like the right thing.”

The allegations against Affleck stem from a pair of sexual harassment civil lawsuits he faced while director of the 2010 Joaquin Phoenix quasi-documentary I’m Still Here. Although Affleck denied any wrongdoing, he ultimately settled both lawsuits.

The allegations of the harassment resurfaced during Affleck’s Best Actor campaign for Manchester by the Sea; following his Oscars win, actress Brie Larson and others refused to clap for Affleck.

“First of all, that I was ever involved in a conflict that resulted in a lawsuit is something that I really regret. I wish I had found a way to resolve things in a different way. I hate that. I had never had any complaints like that made about me before in my life and it was really embarrassing and I didn’t know how to handle it and I didn’t agree with everything, the way I was being described, and the things that were said about me, but I wanted to try to make it right, so we made it right in the way that was asked at the time. And we all agreed to just try to put it behind us and move on with our lives, which I think we deserve to do, and I want to respect them as they’ve respected me and my privacy. And that’s that,” Affleck told the AP.

“Over the past couple of years, I’ve been listening a lot to this conversation, this public conversation, and learned a lot. I kind of moved from a place of being defensive to one of a more mature point of view, trying to find my own culpability. And once I did that I discovered there was a lot to learn. I was a boss. I was one of the producers on the set. This movie was [shot in 2008, 2009] and I was one of the producers. And it was a crazy mockumentary, [a] very unconventional movie. The cast was the crew and the crew was kind of the cast and it was an unprofessional environment and, you know, the buck had to stop with me being one of the producers and I have to accept responsibility for that and that was a mistake.”

Editor’s picks

With Affleck back as director on his upcoming film Light of My Life, he also talked about how the #MeToo and Time’s Up campaigns have impacted Hollywood.

“I think bigger picture, in this business women have been underrepresented and underpaid and objectified and diminished and humiliated and belittled in a bazillion ways and just generally had a mountain of grief thrown at them forever. And no one was really making too much of a fuss about it, myself included, until a few women with the kind of courage and wisdom to stand up and say, ‘You know what? Enough is enough,'” Affleck said.

“Those are the people who are kind of leading this conversation and should be leading the conversation. And I know just enough to know that in general I need to keep my mouth shut and listen and try to figure out what’s going on and be a supporter and a follower in the little, teeny tiny ways that I can.”

Affleck next appears in The Old Man & The Gun, which also marks Robert Redford’s final acting role.
Caitlyn Jenner is having weird sense of joy these days! Says Cellulite makes her feel more feminine!

Caitlyn Jenner, the TV personality, and a former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion is having a different sense of the quality of expressing her womanhood.

She says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her a different sense of joy, and can’t wait to show it off.

A weird article

The headline “Cellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!” from the National Enquirer/RadarOnline is trending these days. And do you want to know what the article says? You must have some info about this!

It said:

“Caitlyn Jenner is telling friends she can’t wait to wear a bikini this summer to show off some skin, and her recently acquired cellulite!”

That seems really weird, doesn’t it? I mean showing it off in a bikini for what? After all, many people try to hide their cellulite and here Jenner is going to a different path.

She is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a “blabbermouth”. And I don’t think it could be wrong. She blabbering about things that makes no sense.

Maybe her excessive talking needed a halt and this quoted name of her may stop her from talking much now. Let’s see what the article had to say other than that.

It said:

“She has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn’t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!”

Maybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can’t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh.

It is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can’t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her.

It is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality every day. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body.

It also said that Jenner’s view: “dimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.” And it was also reported that she wouldn’t mind having more cellulite in her body in the future.

The story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner’s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, Jenner might not want to do it anymore.

“So let it be!” is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason may be her daughter Kim’s cellulite pictures that surfaced online. This might just be a way to support her daughter.

Rumors or truth

This is not the only time some issues or sites posted a rumor about Caitlyn Jenner. Just last year, an issue of National Enquirer said that Jenner “wants her BIG, clunky-feet reduced to more lady-like proportions.”

Again, this just a few days ago, radar online was on about exploring her sexuality online and enjoying a number of secret ‘cyber hookups’.

The transgender star, Jenner has had gender reassignment surgery as well as she said she was never interested in men. There are many rumors which may include some truth about Jenner.

Also read Brandon Jenner states why family members were not waiting when Caitlyn Jenner got eliminated from the reality TV show!

She is the celebrity from the reality show “Keeping Up with Kardashians” along with her daughters.

The custody battle between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie just heated up, with a judge ordering new restrictions for Jolie’s involvement in Pitt’s interaction with their six children.

According to court documents obtained by PEOPLE, Jolie could be in danger of losing primary custody of the children if she doesn’t take steps to improve their relationship with their father. A judge in the couple’s ongoing divorce case said in the documents that “it is critical that each of [the six] children have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother,” and that Jolie must allow Pitt to maintain and repair that.

Family law attorney David Glass, who is not associated with the case, tells PEOPLE that it “is extremely rare” to see a court intervene in this way, though they typically do so after extensive evaluation and to prevent children from being alienated from one parent.

“It looks like what this judge was weighing was the difference between estrangement and alienation,” says Glass, who has not had access to the court documents. “The difference there is, estrangement is when children aren’t connected to one of the parents, mainly because of something that parent did. So a hypothetical, if dad screams and yells at the kids and doesn’t treat them nicely, the kids stop wanting to see dad, that’s estrangement. An alienation refers to where children have been told by the other parent that the parent they’re not seeing is bad, or doesn’t like them, or doesn’t care about them. Just talking badly about the other parent and the kids start to internalize what the other parent is telling them. In alienation cases, kids will typically just repeat words that are beyond their years, or they will repeat reasons that they don’t possibly have access to the information.”

He adds: “It’s a rare case where the court will find that someone alienated the kids. It takes a lot to move the court past estrangement into alienation, but once it’s determined that one parent is alienating the kids, the court has no choice but to jump in and make pretty strong orders right away.”

The judge also outlined specific steps Jolie should take to aid Pitt’s access to and relationship with the children, including a detailed summer visitation schedule, and easy phone access between Pitt and each of the kids, without monitoring or interference from their mom. Glass says that the goal of the new guidelines is to “try to figure out what’s in the children’s best interest.”

“The schedule worked out by the court is the typical post-alienation reunification schedule,” he says. “You see them a couple hours a day and that starts leading to full days and eventually if things go well it leads to overnights, so you’re slowly acclimating the kids to the parent who’s been cut out of the kids lives.”

According to the court documents, the kids have to continue to see their therapist with Pitt, which Glass says is a positive step.

“That’s the first good news, that the kids are in therapy and that dad is somehow involved in the therapy. That’s where the kids can work out whatever issues they have. It’s that continuing contact with dad … all those little pieces that eventually lead to some sort of reunification with their dad.”

Reps for both Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, have not yet responded to a request for comment. Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt on September 19, 2016. The have six children: Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and 9-year old twins Vivienne and Knox.

Selena Gomez, 24, is pregnant with The Weeknd‘s baby, sources claim to Life & Style magazine in their Feb. 13 issue. OMG! “Selena is crazy about The Weeknd, 24, and has told pals that he’s the one,” one insider tells the mag, adding that the “Heart Wants What It Wants” singer has been experiencing cravings. “She’s [dropped] several hints that she’s expecting, complaining to those close to her that she’s too tired to stay out and that she feels nauseous. When she’s not nauseous, though, she’s having weird cravings, and she can’t stop eating ice cream!” That certainly does seem a little fishy.

[jwplatform ZgF9zSkY]

It sounds kind of nuts, but friends say that Selena “can’t wait to have a child of her own”, according to the report, and she’s constantly telling friends “how much she wants to be a mom”. Selena also isn’t concerned about having kids at a relatively young age, as insiders claim to the mag: “Her own mom [Mandy Teefey] had her at 16, and Selena thinks her mom did a great job, so being a young mom has never been an issue.”

HollywoodLifers, do you think it’s too soon for Selena and The Weeknd to get married and start a family together?
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been pretty clear about their desire to start a family eventually. But a new report from Us Weekly has it that the timeline for baby #1 has become accelerated after the royal wedding. Multiple sources have told the outlet that after the ceremony, the two's desire for having kids grew. “Having children is definitely a priority,” a source close to Markle told Us. “She and Harry want to start a family right away—and she’ll start trying as soon as she can.”

A second source that the outlet describes as a royal insider echoed this, though was a little less "this'll happen ASAP." “They both can’t wait to start a family. [Still,] Harry and Meghan won’t rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it. They’ll make fantastic parents.”

A third source chimed in that even Markle's mom Doria Ragland believes that baby will come soon. “Doria is expecting to be a grandmother by this time next year. She’s very excited for Meghan to become a mother.”

Harry and Markle are currently believed to be on their honeymoon, though they are expected to attend the Queen's Trooping of the Colour official birthday parade this Saturday. They have a trip planned to Australia this fall for the Sydney Invictus Games and are said to have a busy second half of the year coming with work engagements. Whether a pregnancy announcement will come before or after all that, we'll see.

In their first interview together after announcing their engagement, Markle and Harry made it clear they hope to have children someday. When asked about their plans to start a family, Harry said, "No [not now], of course, you know, one step at a time. Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future."

At an event in March, Markle hinted that future is nearer rather than farther. The two met a wife-husband entrepreneur duo Sinead and Adam Murphy, who showed the couple products from their Shnuggle line, which include a baby bath and Moses basket. Markle quipped to them, "I’m sure at some point we’ll need the whole thing.”

Selena Gomez, 24, is pregnant with The Weeknd‘s baby, sources claim to Life & Style magazine in their Feb. 13 issue. OMG! “Selena is crazy about The Weeknd, 24, and has told pals that he’s the one,” one insider tells the mag, adding that the “Heart Wants What It Wants” singer has been experiencing cravings. “She’s [dropped] several hints that she’s expecting, complaining to those close to her that she’s too tired to stay out and that she feels nauseous. When she’s not nauseous, though, she’s having weird cravings, and she can’t stop eating ice cream!” That certainly does seem a little fishy.

It sounds kind of nuts, but friends say that Selena “can’t wait to have a child of her own”, according to the report, and she’s constantly telling friends “how much she wants to be a mom”. Selena also isn’t concerned about having kids at a relatively young age, as insiders claim to the mag: “Her own mom [Mandy Teefey] had her at 16, and Selena thinks her mom did a great job, so being a young mom has never been an issue.”

This is a lot to take in, and of course we’re wondering if Selena is nervous about these dramatic changes in her life. Well, yes and no! “She is excited,” a source shares with Life & Style. “She has always talked about having a little girl.”

When it comes to celebrity pranks, not everyone can be George Clooney and go around pranking their friends year round.

No, most stars save their jokes until April Fool’s Day. And this year, Hollywood upped their game — with shocking haircuts, major announcements and one scary on-set prank.

Star Trek star George Takei kicked things off, announcing in the early minutes of Saturday that he was planning a run for Congress in 2018 — targeting California’s 22nd District so he can take on Republican Devin Nunes.

Takei told The Daily Buzz that he wanted to take a bigger stand in politics. “With what is going on now in the country, I couldn’t stand by any longer merely as a citizen,” Takei said. “I knew I had to take a bigger stand. So that’s why I’m running for Congress. My hope is to challenge Devin Nunes for his seat in 2018.”

The 79-year-old actor let the world wait over 8 hours before revealing the truth — tweeting a photo of him holding a sign that read, “Gotcha!”

“No, I’m not running for Congress. Happy 4/1!,” he wrote. “But Jon Ossoff is on 4/18. Help him win at electjon.com. Let’s flip Congress in ’18.”

Minutes before Takei’s reveal, swimming champion Michael Phelps took his own stab at an April’s Fools Day prank — tweeting that he was ready to come out of retirement to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

“Some dreams/goals you just can’t get rid of,” the 41-year-old athlete wrote. “Been doing a lot of thinking n I’ve decided that I’m going 2 make another comeback! #tokyo2020.”

Sadly, for those hoping the 23-time gold medalist would be trying build on his historic success after his last Olympic Games wrapped in Rio, they’re out of luck.

Team USA quickly screen-grabbed the tweet, posting it to Instagram with the caption “#aprilfools.”

Rebel Wilson‘s April Fools Day prank had everyone scrambling on the set of Pitch Perfect 3.

The 37-year-old comedian laid on the ground outside one of the film’s trailers, as concerned cast members and crew came to her aid.

Before things got too serious, some of the folks who were in on the prank screamed “April Fools!” — as seen in video of the prank Wilson posted to Instagram.

“Tragic accident on the set of Pitch Perfect 3,” she wrote. “Just kidding! Happy April Fools Pitches! I got you!!!”

For all the Bravoholics out there, Real Housewives of New York City star Bethenny Frankel had a surprise on Saturday — posting a shot of herself on Instagram with a new pixie haircut.

She captioned the shot, “#shorthairdontcare” and “#newseasonnewlook” (among others).

Of course, anyone following Frankel on Snapchat would know the 46-year-old Skinnygirl mogul was just joking around — as her she’s been showing off her bob on the social media site while skiing with her 6-year-old daughter, Bryn.

Gigi Hadid also pulled a hairdo prank, sharing a shot of herself with what appeared to be short hair and scissor emojis. However she later updated the caption to share that it was just a prank.

Is Jennifer Aniston is ready to look for love again? Should people get their CVs ready for a shot at a relationship with her?

The Friends star is back on the market since separating from her husband Justin Theroux – but is ready to mingle seeing as her ex is reportedly dating again.

The 49-year-old may have just split from her 46-year-old husband but that’s is not going to stop her from living her best life.

‘Jen is in a good place right now and very much satisfied with how things are panning out after her separation with Justin,’ a source told HollywoodLife.com.

The insider continued: ‘She likes having the monkey off her back and she is enjoying being single. She loves being able to do her own thing and to only have to report to herself.’

But is she ready jump back into the dating pool?

‘Love is taking a back seat as she is much more interested in her work and just living life. She doesn’t have any eyes for a man right now and is taking her newly available time for herself,’ the source concluded.

That’s right Jen – you don’t need a man to live your life to the fullest.

Both actors have not yet spoken out about their split since releasing a joint statement in February that read: ‘In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation.

This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.’

These reports come after it was said that Justin has reportedly started dating the artist and photographer Petra Collins.

Star magazine has claimed the actor and screenwriter is ‘obsessed’ with the Canadian and has been ‘enjoying cosy dinner dates’ with the 25-year-old, who’s a regular on the glittering social circuit.

A source told the publication: ‘Justin and Petra have been carrying on for some time. He insists that they’re just “friends” but he seems obsessed with her, and Jen isn’t buying it.’

According to the source the two met on the ‘New York arts scene and hit it off right away’.

Then last month, the actor tagged Petra in one of his Instagram shots shortly before he and Jen released a statement proclaiming their separation after three years of marriage.

The two of them – headless, weirdly – posed next to each other in T-shirts by designer pal Adam Selman – which has now been taken over by comments and speculation by followers and fans.

Angelina Jolie has officially moved on from her relationship with Brad Pitt—and she's dating a regular dude (AKA not an actor). More specifically, she's dating a handsome older man who sells homes for a living.

"Brad and Angie are both very secretive about their dating life. Angie has told some friends she isn't ready to date, but she has been seeing a handsome, older-looking man who is a real estate agent," a source tells ET. "He isn't a celebrity or high profile in any way."

The source explains that "Angie was in a very bad place" after splitting from Brad in September 2016, and that "just having another adult to spend time with has been helpful."

Meanwhile, Brad also appears to be dating, and he's also avoiding actors. "He's very private about who he’s seeing, but he does continue to casually date," the source says. "The women he sees are not in the public eye."

By the way, don't get your hopes up about Brad and Angie consciously re-coupling anytime soon because "they can barely be in the same room together." 👀

Congressman Steve Scalise, the House Majority Whip, was one of at least five people injured from a shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, on Wednesday. A gunman opened fire during a congressional baseball practice, and President Trump, Lin-Manuel Miranda, George Takei, and other celebrities are responding in its aftermath.

“Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a true friend and patriot, was badly injured but will fully recover,” Trump tweeted. “Our thoughts and prayers are with him.” Other politicians raising their voices include Senator Kamala Harris, who called the shooting “horrific,” and Congressman Ted Lieu, who wrote, “My thoughts and prayers are with the victims injured by this senseless shooting in Alexandria today.”

Shortly after 7 a.m. ET, Alexandria police were notified of a shooting at E. Monroe Street. Police Chief Michael Brown gave a statement on the situation to press after a suspect was taken into custody and five people were transported to local hospitals.

According to the Associated Press, the gunman was carrying a rifle and was wounded by return fire from officers. Scalise was taken to George Washington University Hospital in stable condition. Republican Senator Jeff Flake told the AP, “We were doing batting practice. All of a sudden we heard a very loud shot. The gunman was over by the third base dugout with a clear view of the field.”

“The shooting in Alexandria this AM was a senseless horrific act,” Takei tweeted. “My thoughts are with Rep. Scalise, the Capitol Police & all those impacted.” Miranda also offered his “prayers and thoughts,” while Katie Couric asked, “God what is happening in this country?”

Hollywood executives are “blood-thirsty Satanists” who “ritually abuse children in the industry”, according to Macaulay Culkin, who claims he only got out alive because he was a “smart, suspicious kid” and he “got too famous to be killed like some of the other kids”.

“You learn very early to recognize which of them want to abuse you, and which of them have even darker tastes”, Macaulay Culkin said, explaining that “the worst of them wear shoes made out of the skin of children that they ritually murdered.”

Speaking on radio in Paris, France, Culkin said “Have you seen leather products made from human skin? It has a very unusual, distinctive look. I learned at a very young age to identify it.”

The news was picked up by French media, with mainstream French newspapers reporting on the explosive interview. However, within an hour of publication all reports had been removed from the internet.

French newspaper Les Echos’ headline translated into English: “Macaulay Culkin speaks about Hollywood ritual child abuse live on radio”. Les Echos have not responded to questions regarding why they deleted the article within an hour of publication, and if they were pressured to do so.

Les Echo’s report translated into English: “Macaulay Culkin claims Hollywood studio executives rape and murder child stars and use their skin to make boots, belts and wallets that they use as ‘skin trophies’.”

Skin Trophies

During the interview, Culkin claimed that children in the entertainment industry “learn very early to recognize which of them want to abuse you, and which of them have even darker tastes,” explaining that some of the Hollywood executives wear “skin trophies”. Explaining that he was 11 the first time he saw human leather, Culkin said he was “filming Home Alone 2 in New York” when he was “ushered into a back room on the set. There was a guy in there, a powerful executive suit type, you know what I mean?”

“He tried to make me relax. Gave me a can of Coke. Started telling me about the nature of the industry. Basically he wanted me to cut my parents out. He wanted to be my guardian. He said he would make me into the biggest teen star in history. He said I had it all. He said I had to get rid of my parents. I was like ‘Dude, I’m 11!’ and he said ‘You’re a man now’.”

Culkin, who has been living in Paris, France since 2003, then explained that the man “began to make his intentions clear”. “He started breathing real shallow. My experience with perverts kicked in. I could tell he was interested in me.

He licked his lips and told me I was very handsome. I think I managed to say ‘thank you’ and started thinking about how I could get immediately out of there.

Then he reached into his case and took out a crack pipe. He put it in his lap, took out this huge lighter, and continued to gaze at me with this overpowering sexual desire.”

“I was just staring at him. I think I said something like ‘Dude, I’m 11’ again.

I remember he said to me: ‘It’s a celebration, little man. To celebrate your upcoming success. Your many successes. Come. Sit back down’.

He was tapping the pipe on his crotch, smiling this total creepazoid smile. I ran out of the room, but I ran straight into this other guy who was outside the room and he grabbed me by the arm and threw me back inside.”

“He lit the pipe and blew the smoke in my face. He told me to look at his shoes. He said they were made from the skin of children he and his friends had murdered. He said leather made from human skin is the finest leather known to man.”

Death of a child star

Macaulay Culkin said the Hollywood executive then dropped a heavy hint about the provenance of the skin used to make his shoes.

“He asked me if I knew Heather O’Rourke. Yeah, I remembered her. I grew up watching Poltergeist. I remembered her in Happy Days. She was so cute. I vomited all over his shoes.”

Heather O’Rourke was an American child actress, discovered by director Steven Spielberg when she was visiting MGM’s studios and later cast as Carol Anne Freeling in the horror film Poltergeist. She had the movie’s most recognizable line: “They’re here!”.

After years in the Hollywood system, Heather O’Rourke died suddenly and unexpectedly at the age of 12. The official cause of death was listed as “heart attack and septic shock” caused by a “misdiagnosed intestinal stenosis” in 1988, though many people were left wondering if there was more to the tragic story.

“Let’s just say I went off the rails after my experiences filming Home Alone 2. I’m 37 now and I’m still processing everything. The things I have seen…” Culkin said, before trailing off and abruptly changing the topic.

Culkin’s legacy

There are a fair few things Macaulay Culkin is remembered for.

People like to talk about his years of reported heroin addiction, which snowballed into rumors that he spent an obscene amount of money on drugs. Others chat about his friendship with pop star Michael Jackson, as well as him fronting a pizza-themed comedy rock band.

But Culkin no longer has the rail thin, sickly appearance of a junkie. Carrying some weight around the midriff, Culkin is looking happier now, and is filming the lead role for friend Seth Green’s vehicle Changeland.

Speaking about the future, Culkin said “I’ve come out the other side. I’m alive. That is more than can be said for many. I’m not finished yet. Hollywood is going to burn in my lifetime. You watch.”

Nikki Reed and Nina Dobrev have always gotten along.

That news might come as surprise to some people, given that multiple tabloids have claimed the actresses were "at war" over Ian Somerhalder, Reed's husband and Dobrev's ex-boyfriend. But, as Dobrev returned to film an episode of The Vampire Diaries this week, she posed for a photo with the Twilight star, proving once and for all that there's no bad blood between them.

Joined by the couple, Dobrev updated her Instagram Tuesday. "Can't believe how time flies," she wrote. "Farewell dinner with team Somereed! So good catching up with these goofballs."

Reed shared a similar photo on Instagram used it as a means to call out the tabloids.
Royal baby No. 3 is here! Kate Middleton and Prince William welcomed their third child on Monday, April 23 at 11:01 a.m. in the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s hospital.

Just like when Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stopped for a few quick photos in front of the hospital before they returned to Kensington Palace with their new prince. Duchess Kate wore a red dress with a white lace collar by Jenny Packham, making this the third time she’s worn a bespoke dress by the British designer for her post-birth appearances.

The red dress appeared to be a nod to the outfit Princess Diana wore when she introduced Prince Harry to the world in 1984. Both dresses were bright red with a white Peter Pan collar.

Getty Images

This wasn't the first time Kate paid homage to her late mother-in-law after giving birth. Kate introduced Prince George to the world in July 2013 wearing a short-sleeved blue dress by Jenny Packham that nodded to the polka-dot dress Princess Diana wore when leaving the hospital with Prince William three decades earlier.

Getty Images

When Princess Charlotte arrived in May 2015, Duchess Kate opted for another pastel Jenny Packham number, but this time her yellow dress in a buttercup print had longer sleeves to accommodate for the cooler spring weather just like the red dress did today.

Getty Images

Princess Charlotte also wore a knit cap when she went out into the world for the first time, while Prince George enjoyed the July weather sans-hat on his first outing. Both royal babies were swaddled in a white G.H. Hurt & Son soft wool baby shawl.

Since the weather in London was rather cold and windy today, the new prince also wore a knit cap and what appears to be the same G.H. Hurt & Son baby shawl as his siblings.

Getty Images

The previous two times Duchess Kate stepped out with her newborns she wore light-colored heels, but her Dune sling-back espadrilles were better suited for the July weather than the leather Jimmy Choo pumps she wore to introduce Charlotte.

Getty Images

Duchess Kate went for neutral shoes once again with baby no. 3, opting to re-wear what appears to be her Gianvito Rossi “Gianvito 105” pumps in taupe suede.

Prince George also made an appearance at the hospital when his little sister Charlotte was born, just like his dad Prince William did to greet Prince Harry.

Today, Prince William brought both Prince George and Princess Charlotte to meet their new little brother. This time around George didn’t match with his father, since he came straight from school wearing his uniform. Charlotte, however, was dressed for the occasion in a blue floral Liberty print dress and stole the crowd's heart by showing off her royal wave, while Prince George was a little more shy this time around.

“I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”

As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”

She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”

The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.

When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”

Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.

A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”

Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”
Blake Shelton is making Gwen Stefani blush.

At a concert in Oklahoma on Friday, the country singer plated a kiss on his girlfriend when she joined him on stage during the show, and adorably embarrassed her a bit when he started dishing on the early days of their romance.

Some of those in attendance at the private concert shared the cute moment to social media, and captured the No Doubt singer's bashful smile as Shelton jokingly teased her about the start of their flirtation.

"We were starting to hang out together and mess around," Shelton, 41, recalled as the audience cheered in support and Stefani, who had rested her head on his shoulder, looked up at him mock-surprised at his candidness.

"You know, texting each other, starting out as friends," Shelton quickly added, trying to assuage the embarrassment.

"I think people are going to realize just how dumb he really is when they see him on national television, in an environment where there's no script," Shelton joked. "But you're also gonna see what a great, great dude that guy is… I love Luke like a brother, I really do, but he's just dumb."

Honeymoon gone wrong. A lawsuit has been filed against Hollywood producer Joel Silver for the drowning of his assistant, Carmel Musgrove, who was found dead while celebrating Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s honeymoon in 2015.

According to the papers obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Silver’s company, Silver Pictures, flew the 28-year-old out to the Four Seasons Hotel in Bora Bora along with others on a chartered Gulfstream to celebrate the marriage of Aniston and Theroux.

On August 18, 2015, Musgrove reportedly went on a fishing trip and then had dinner with Silver’s family, where alcohol was supplied.

The lawsuit — which was filed on Friday, August 18, in L.A. County Superior Court — claims that after dinner, Musgrove went to the bungalow of Silver’s personal chef, Martin Herold, and indulged in cocaine and marijuana before retreating back to her room around 11 p.m. She reportedly sent a message to Herold that said “Xxx” around midnight and asked hotel staff for matches. The staff member who supplied the matches was allegedly the last person to see her alive.

After more than a day of searching, her nude body was found floating in a lagoon just 500 yards away from her bungalow.

The suit questions how an email managed to be sent from her account at 7:04 a.m., if she had died during a midnight swim. It also states that Musgrove’s death was due in part to alcohol, cocaine, work fatigue, heat stroke and swimming in choppy waters.

After Musgrove’s death, Silver’s publicist released a statement that said, “Joel Silver, his family and his staff are devastated by the passing of Carmel Musgrove. Carmel was a dear friend and respected colleague with a very bright future ahead of her. They will all miss her dearly.”

The honeymoon festivities, which were attended by Courteney Cox, Chelsea Handler and Jason Bateman, occurred just one day after Aniston and Theroux tied the knot at their Bel Air mansion. Us Weekly exclusively reported the surprise August 2015 wedding, where other guests included Lisa Kudrow, Howard Stern and Ellen DeGeneres.

It's almost meteorological. The funny thing about a backlash is the way it opens things up and builds momentum on its own. It's no coincidence that the metaphors we use for a backlash tend to be come from climactic phenomenon -- an opening of the floodgates, a turning of the tide, when it rains it pours. A backlash, though made by human beings, can feel like a part of the natural world and its inexorable forces. And that seems to be what's happening right now with Taylor Swift.

And while there are good things to say about Swift -- her pushing back against streaming services that shaft musicians, for instance -- this tide-turning comes not a moment too soon. I don't say this because I hate Taylor Swift or because I think she's talentless. It's because of the weird consensus that's shaped up around her in the last year or two: That she's a brave young woman who's earned it all herself, that she's "just like us," that she should be lionized for her success at the game of self-branding, that she's a musical genius, that this scion of a multi-generational banking fortune is -- as the New York Times said of her not long ago -- some kind of "underdog."

Despite this weird worship of wealth and power that's grown up in post-Great Recession America -- which has helped Swift immensely -- not everyone loves Swift or her oddly lifeless, machine-made music. But these critical voices have been marginalized. She's like the prom queen who drives the brand-new Mercedes to school, whose parents buy everyone cookies: If you defy her you are some kind of envious grouch or killjoy. Our job is simply to obey.

But the superstar's Twitter incident with Nicki Minaj -- spurred by MTV's Video Music Awards snubbing Minaj's "Anaconda" video -- has opened up a broader discussion about Swift's privilege and preening and phoniness, and it's about time. The Guardian has called Swift's response to Minaj -- she blamed it on men -- "faux-feminist" and "tone deaf." The typically sober Atlantic charges Swift with "uses the pretext of female solidarity to try and shut down [Minaj's] frustration with the music industry." (Minaj was complaining about the way black musician often get overlooked.)

And the press and media -- which has bowed to Swift's every move -- may be just getting started in this new direction. This is from a substantial new Gawker piece, "Taylor Swift is Not Your Friend," which documents a lot of over-the-top blather praising her.

It’s surprising to see smart people talk about Swift with such breathlessly positive overtures, not only because—like pop stars before her and pop stars after her—her music is simple and unfussy and infused with inane platitudes, but also because there appears to be something more opportunistic and sinister at play. When Taylor Swift does the mega-pop stardom act, she does it to the tilt. Swift has to be the person with the prettiest friends, the biggest records, the most popular and successful and groanworthily obvious boyfriend. The underdog narrative that the Swift machine has built is one of forced falsehoods; Swift is not coming from behind. She’s been ahead since she started. And watching her collect best friends during a moment in history when womanhood is finally beginning to feel valued does not only feel uncomfortable—it feels evil.

It's also hard not to find the ultraviolent "Bad Blood" video a bit, uh, bloodthirsty, especially given that much of her audience is young girls who may not be legally admitted to PG-13 movies. But Dayna Evans's Gawker piece says the video perfectly illustrates Swift's ruthlessness and feminist posing. "Swift isn’t here to help women—she’s here to make bank," she writes. "Seeing her on stage cavorting with World Cup winners and supermodels was not a win for feminism, but a win for Taylor Swift. Her plan—to be as famous and as rich as she can possibly be—is working, and by using other women as tools of her self-promotion, she is distilling feminism for her own benefit."

So how far will this go? One thing we've learned lately is that Swift has very smart, savvy people working for her. She's a master of PR, and she could spin this all her way and go back to ordering us mortals to do her laundry and clear her table. But at least for now, we're enjoying a more honest, wide-ranging conversation about a figure who's been coddled for far too long.
Daniel Radcliffe may “disapperate” right off the market! The 27 year-old Harry Potter star has reportedly asked his girlfriend of five years TV and film actress Erin Darke, 28, to marry him, according to Star magazine. Despite denials of an engagement from Daniel’s reps, multiple sources told the mag about the couple’s alleged ring shopping outings. “Daniel recently took Erin ring shopping and spared no expense,” the insider said. “They’ve been talking about marriage for a while now and thought this was something worth splurging on.”

[jwplatform x3lQHDfB]

Daniel reportedly is not one to splurge on major expenses even though he has $97 million at his disposal. He’s practically richer than Gringotts! He and Erin “live a very quiet, ordinary life together in Manhattan,” a source told the mag. The pair have definitely lived their lives fairly under the radar with the exception of a truly impressive karaoke performance! Daniel and Erin were spotted in Half Moon Bay, CA during the summer of 2015 giving their all to a performance of Eminem’s “The Real Slim Shady.” We love these two together! A source described Erin as “an incredibly calming influence on Daniel,” who struggled with alcoholism during his Harry Potter tenure and has been sober for more than three years now.

Fans will be waiting longer than a few years for Daniel to don his Hogwarts robes again, but the actor did leave a small chance for his return in the future. “The circumstances would have to be pretty extraordinary. But then I am sure Harrison Ford said that with Han Solo and look what happened there! So I am saying, ‘No,’ for now but leaving room to backtrack in the future,” he told Britain’s Radio Times in June 2016. Wouldn’t that be amazing?

Savannah Chrisley apparently doesn't know best when it comes to relationships.

RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned the 19-year-old reality star has been dumped by her NBA player boyfriend, Luke Kennard, after only two months of dating!

"Luke broke up with Savannah, and she is crushed," a source close to situation revealed. "While they were on their recent trip to the Cayman Islands he decided that she was not the type of woman he wanted to be with anymore. He basically told her that he was done."
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were victims of an intruder who entered their property through the front gate of their mansion in Bel Air on Friday, October 20, the Los Angeles Police Department confirms to Us Weekly. The suspect did not enter their home.

“A witness observed a suspect enter and exit the victim’s vehicle and then flee the location,” an LAPD PIO tells Us. “A second suspect who was hiding in some bushes also fled the location. Suspect No. 1 took personal items from the victim’s vehicle.”

The cars did not belong to Kardashian or West. However, some of their staff’s vehicles were on the property at the time. The suspect entered through the front gate at the end of the long driveway.

A source tells Us, “The second their private armed security guards noticed the intruder, they came out with guns drawn and flash lights out. The person turned around and ran away for their lives.”

According to TMZ, which was first to report the news, the perpetrator also trashed a car in the driveway of the couple’s neighbor Kathy Griffin. He reportedly stole the comedian’s purse before ditching it nearby. The burglaries occurred just one day after $50,000 worth of purses and sunglasses were stolen from Mariah Carey‘s mansion in L.A., according to TMZ.

The burglary at Kardashian and West’s home came one year after she was robbed at gunpoint in Paris. As previously reported, a group of armed men broke into the 36-year-old reality star’s hotel room and stole more than $10 million worth of jewelry. Ten people were charged in connection with the crime.

Kardashian opened up about the harrowing experience in an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians earlier this month. “Ever since Paris, I just go through this worst case scenario mode in my head,” she explained.
Blac Chyna is calling her ex Rob Kardashian a cyber bully and revenge porn perpetrator after he posted several nude photos of her on Instagram and Twitter.

Chyna, who was accompanied by her lawyer Lisa Bloom, told Lindsey Davis of ABC News that she is filing a temporary domestic violence restraining order to stop Kardashian from posting about her on social media in addition to keeping him physically away from her. "Good Morning America" aired a clip from the interview.

She said, "I was devastated. Of course, I was like, how could somebody post these pictures of me? I'm like, wow, okay, this is a person I trusted. I just felt ... betrayed."

Bloom said, "Revenge porn is a crime, a civil wrong and form of domestic abuse."

Chyna said she decided to take legal action after talking to Kardashian, who is the father of her daughter, Dream. She also alleged that he physically abused her in April.

"I talked to Rob about everything," she said. "The moral of the story is he doesn't respect me. If you can't respect me, you have to respect the law."

Chyna said she wants to inspire victims of revenge porn and cyber bullying to take action, and that it's irrelevant that she has posted racy photos of herself in the past.

"I'm Blac Chyna," she said. "I can do whatever I want. It's my body."

Chyna also shot down rumors that she got together with Kardashian in order to get revenge on her ex, Tyga, who left her to date Kardashian's half-sister, Kylie Jenner.

"That's not even my character," she said. "I see all these things on the internet and I never address it because I'm a bigger person. Robert came at me." She added that she was never trying to use the Kardashians for fame: "I was already Blac Chyna before the Kardashians."

Chyna said she has not heard from any of the Kardashians since Rob posted the photos. She addressed rumors circulating about her online spat with Kardashian, who claimed Chyna cheated on him during their relationship (Chyna said the two broke up in December). Kardashian wrote on social media that he was set off after Chyna sent him a video of herself kissing another man.

Chyna admitted to sending Kardashian the video, but said it was to get him off her back.

"Maybe if I send this video to him, he'll leave me alone," she said of her thought process. She added that she never "liked" any of the nude photos he posted of her, as rumored, and that she had him blocked on Instagram.

Though Chyna and Bloom are to file the restraining order on Monday, Chyna said she plans to keep joint custody of Dream with Kardashian.
The sun may be shining in Los Angeles, but there's still a cool breeze.

Jennifer Garner stayed warm and cozy on Tuesday by wearing a multi-colored and oversized scarf (reminiscent of Lenny Kravitz's infamous outerwear he wore in 2012) while out with her gal pals in L.A. on her birthday. The former Alias star, who turned 46 this week, outfitted the knitted scarf with sporty black leggings, a gray zip-up jacket, red-white-and-blue sneakers and tortoiseshell shades. Her brunette tresses were up in a long ponytail and she carried a water bottle, coffee cup and her phone in one hand.

Garner later revealed on Instagram that that the massive scarf was a birthday gift from her daughter Seraphina.

"When your nine year old weaves a 12ft long scarf on a peg loom for your birthday present, you’d better #werk #fashionfriday #thecarpoollineismyrunway #proudmom," she captioned another pic of her colorful fashion statement.

The actress appeared to have been in good spirits during her birthday, turning herself into a meme and taking to Instagram to thank everyone for their well wishes.

"I’m having the best birthday and so much of it is because of all of you. Thank you for the birthday love! ❤️❤️❤️," she wrote alongside the silly pic of herself doing her hair.

Undoubtedly, 46 will be a good year for Garner as she makes her return to television with the series Camping, will kick-ass in the spy-thriller Peppermint, and continues to treat fans to all her wonderful Instagram videos and pics.

Drama!

Beyoncé gave birth to twins — a boy and a girl — on Monday, June 12, but the delivery didn't go as smoothly as she and husband JAY-Z had planned.

Despite conducting trial runs with her security team, the day was chaotic — In Touch exclusively learned.

"There was a lot of drama, specifically with the Knowles family,” says a source. "Beyoncé made it clear that she wanted this day to run smoothly, but her family just did not listen."

The superstar, who stayed at UCLA Medical Center with her twins following an unspecified health issue, was reportedly furious.

"This was supposed to be one of the most touching and beautiful days of her life," adds the source. "But Beyoncé was so stressed out because of all the fighting."

Bey's estranged father, Mathew Knowles, was one of the day's biggest stressors. Her former manager called so often that sister Solange, 30, had to intervene. Their mom, Tina, also picked up the phone and had "some pretty harsh words for Mathew," says the source.

Back in May, In Touch reported that Beyoncé feared her dad would show up unannounced.

“She is fearful that he’ll show up uninvited like he did with [their five-year-old daughter] Blue. She doesn’t want him anywhere nearby on her special day. She fully expects everything to be perfect as they become a family of five,” said a source at the time.

The family “didn’t want him there because they don't trust him not to leak private information about the twins — or even worse, take photos."

In fact, Mathew announced the birth of his grandchildren before his daughter did, and the Beyhive was furious.

In an Instagram post, he captioned the photo, "They're here!"

To add to the drama, there was also some tension between Tina and JAY-Z.

The 35-year-old "gave birth via a planned C-section, so only one person was allowed in the delivery room," says the source, adding that she chose her husband.

Tina, 63, then "got really salty and made a comment about Jay not being home for the hard parts of Beyoncé’s pregnancy. She ended up leaving the hospital for a breather."

Yet now that the babies are finally here, the family of five can relax.

“She is so relieved it’s all over and is so happy the twins are finally here,” says the source, adding that she and Jay, 47, have taken a ton of photos and videos that they plan to use in a future documentary. “Despite all the drama, she really feels like her life is perfect right now.”

It’s hard to imagine a better looking couple than Brangelina, but since Angelina Jolie, 41, and Brad Pitt, 53, are officially over we have to open our minds to seeing her with someone else. And if that someone else is Jared Leto, 45, we’re not mad at it.

We absolutely loved them in Alexander and who could forget Girl, Interrupted. But it tuns out these two shared more than just the screen. “Jared and Angelina had a very casual relationship years and years ago, it was a friends with benefits situation,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com

So, why didn’t they ever get serious? According to our source Jared was just too much of a player. “It might have turned into more but Jared was too noncommittal at the time, he just wasn’t ready to be with one woman, not even Angelina. Then Brad came on the scene and she fell in love and that was that. I know Jared always had regrets about letting her slip away.” Yup, big mistake Jared. Huge.

Luckily for the Suicide Squad hottie he may just be getting another shot with the world’s most beautiful woman. “Jared reached out to Angie after she filed divorce papers in Sep.,” an insider told Star in the magazine’s Feb. 27 issue. “The word is they spoke several times on the phone before meeting up in L.A. for dinner, and they’ve been seeing each other whenever they can since then.” We can totally see these two as a couple.

HollywoodLifers, do you think Jared was a fool for not hanging on to Angelina the first time around? Do you think they’ll get more serious this time? Or will he play her all over again? Let us know in the comments!
Katherine Jackson is bowing out of the guardian biz when it comes to Michael Jackson's youngest child, Blanket.

According to docs filed by Katherine ... there's no longer any need for her to be the 15-year-old's guardian. Katherine had been appointed joint guardian -- along with TJ Jackson -- of all 3 of Michael's kids in 2012.

Both Paris and Prince are adults now, but Katherine says because Blanket has reached his adolescence ... TJ can handle guardianship on his own. She also points to her own age, 87, as a reason she's stepping down.

Worth noting ... Katherine had not seen her grandchildren for several months earlier this year. It's still unclear how much contact she's had with MJ's children.
Third time may not be the charm for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West! The rapper is reportedly completely ignoring his duties as a new dad in the weeks since the couple’s daughter, Chicago West, was born. Just days after Chicago’s birth, Kanye jetted off to New York for several days, leaving Kim home alone with all three kids, and when he is home, he’s been refusing to change diapers or wake up for late night feedings, according to Star. “Kim let it slide the first time, but she was counting on counting on Kanye to help out around the house because she already has her hands full,” the mag’s insider claims. “Kim was furious when Kanye told her to just hire another nanny. She made it clear that he petter start pulling his weight — or else.”

Chicago was born via surrogate on Jan. 15, and is just one of the newest additions to the Kardashian family. On Feb. 1, Kylie Jenner, 20, gave birth to her first child — a baby girl named Stormi Webster. That means Kim and Kylie’s daughters are less than one month apart, and Kim wrote the sweetest message to her little sis about it. “I’m so incredibly proud of the woman you have grown up to be and I know that you are going to be the best mom to your new baby girl!” she gushed. “Our girls are two weeks apart and I can’t wait for them to be besties! I am so proud that you do what you want to do and live your life the way you want you will pass down all of those amazing qualities to your baby girl. You were made to be a mom!”

Meanwhile, Khloe Kardashian is currently pregnant with her first child, and is due at the end of March/beginning of April — so there’ll be another little one added to the mix in just a couple of months!

HollywoodLifers, do you think Kanye will step up as a dad?
Despite what you may have heard, Kourtney Kardashian is not with child.

The reality star took to Twitter on Tuesday to dispel several reports that she is pregnant, based on an interview she gave to Grazia magazine.

"The interviewer asked me 'What’s a crazy rumor that you’ve heard about yourself?' and my answer was...'I’ve heard that I am pregnant,'" the 38-year-old mom of three tweeted. "I see online that I said I was pregnant in an interview, but that was completely taken out of context."

If Kourtney was pregnant, the Kardashian-Jenner Rugrats-style playpen (that surely exists) would about to get pretty crowded, as four of the five sisters -- eighty percent -- would be expecting a child.

Watch the video below for everything you need to know about Kylie Jenner, Khloe Kardashian and Kim Kardashian West's babies-on-the-way.
